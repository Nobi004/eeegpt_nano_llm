(ii) the percentage of harmonic content in the current wave is the same as in the applied voltage. (b) Pure Inductance Let the inductance of the circuit be L henry whose reactance varies directly as the frequency of the applied voltage. Its reactance for the fundamental would be X = ωL; for the second 1 harmonic, X = 2ωL, for the third harmonic, X = 2ωL and for the nth harmonic X = nωL. 2 3 nHarmonics 763 However, for every harmonic term, the current will lag behind the voltage by 90°. E Current due to fundamental, i = 1m sin(ωt−π/2) 1 ωL E Current due to 2nd harmonic, i = 2m sin(2ωt−π/2) 2 2ωL E Current due to 3rd harmonic, i = 3m sin(3ωt−π/2) 3 3ωL E Current due to nth harmonic, i = nm sin(nωt−π/2) n nωL ∴ Total current i=i +i +.....i 1 2 n E E E 1msin( t /2) 2m sin(2 t /2) .... nm sin(n t /2) L 2 L n L It can be seen from the above equation that (i) the waveform of the current differs from that of the applied voltage. (ii) for the nth harmonic, the percentage harmonic content in the current-wave is 1/n of the corresponding harmonic content in the voltage wave. It means that in an inductive circuit, the current waveform shows less distortion that the voltage waveform. In this case, current more nearly approaches a sine wave than it does in a circuit containing resistance. (c) Pure Capacitance In this case, Capacitor 1 1 X 1 = ωC – for fundamental ; X 2 = 2ωC – for 2nd harmonic X 3 = 3ω 1 C – for 3rd harmonic ; X n = nω 1 C – for nth harmonic E i = 1m sin(ωt+π/2)=ωCE sin(ωt+π/2) 1 1/ωC 1n The amount of charge the device can E store for a given voltage difference is i = 2m sin(2ωt+π/2)=2ωCE sin(2ωt+π/2) called the capacitance 2 1/2ωC 2m E i = nm sin(nωt+π/2)= nωCE sin(nωt+π/2) n 1/nωC nm For every harmonic term, the current will lead the voltage by 90°. Now i = i + i + ...... + i 1 2 n =ωCE sin(ωt+π/2)+2ωCE sin(2ωt+π/2)+...+nωCE sin(nωt+π/2) 1m 2m nm This equation shows that (i) the current and voltage waveforms are dissimilar. (ii) percentage harmonic content of the current is larger than that of the applied voltage wave. For example, for nth harmonic, it would be n time larger. (iii) as a result, the current wave is more distorted than the voltage wave. (iv) effect of capacitor on distortion is just the reverse of that of inductance.764 Electrical Technology Example 20.5.

Selective Resonance due to Harmonics When a complex voltage is applied across a circuit containing both inductance and capacitance, it may happen that the circuit resonates at one of the harmonic frequencies of the applied voltage. This phenomenon is known as selective resonance. If it is a series circuit, then large currents would be produced at resonance, even though the applied voltage due to this harmonic may be small. Consequently, it would result in large harmonic voltage appearing across both the capacitor and the inductance.768 Electrical Technology If it is a parallel circuit, then at resonant frequency, the resultant current drawn from the supply would be minimum. It is because of the possibility of such selective resonance happening that every effort is made to eliminate harmonics in supply voltage. However, the phenomenon of selective resonance has been usefully employed in some wave analyses for determining the harmonic content of alternating waveforms. For this purpose, a variable inductance, a variable capacitor, a variable non-inductive resistor and a fixed non- inductive resistance or shunt for an oscillograph are connected in series and connected to show the wave-form of the voltage across the fixed non-inductive resistance. The values of inductance and capacitance are adjusted successively to give resonance for the first, third, first and seventh harmonics and a record of the waveform is obtained by the oscillograph. A quick inspection of the shape of the waveform helps to detect the presence or absence of a particular harmonic. Example 20.12.

Effect of Harmonics on Measurement of Inductance and Capacitance Generally, with the help of ammeter and voltmeter readings, the value of impedance, inductance and capacitance of a circuit can be calculated. But while dealing with complex voltages, the use of instrument readings does not, in general, give correct values of inductance and capacitance except in the case of a circuit containing only pure resistance. It is so because, in the case of resistance, the voltage and current waveforms are similar and hence the values of r.m.s. volts and r.m.s amperes (as read by the voltmeter and ammeter respectively) would be the same whether they ware sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal (i.e. complex). (i) Effect on Inductances Let L be the inductance of a circuit and E and I the r.m.s. values of the applied voltage and current as read by the instruments connected in the circuit. For a complex voltage E =0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+.....) 1m 3n 5m E 2 E 2 E Hence I = 0.707 1m 3m 5m ..... L 3 L 5 L 0.707 1 1 L E 1m 2 9 E 3m 2 25 E 5m 2 ... 0.707 1 1 ∴ L I E 1m 2 9 E 3m 2 25 E 5m 2 ..... For calculating the value of L from the above expression, it is necessary to known the absolute value of the amplitudes of several harmonic voltages. But, in practices, it is more convenient to deal with relative values than with absolute values. For this purpose, let us multiply and divide the right-hand side of the above expression by E but write the E in the denominator in its form 0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+.......) 1m 3m 5m ∴ L 0.707 E 2 1/9.E 2 1/25.E 2 .....

I 1 (E /E )2 (E /E)2 ..... 1m 3m 5m 3m 1m 5m 1 If the effect of harmonics were to be neglected, then the value of the inductance would appear to be E/ω I but the true or actual value is less than this. The apparent value has to be multiplied by the quantity under the radical to get the true value of inductance when harmonics are present. The quantity under the radical is called the correction factor i.e. True inductance (L) = Apparent inductance (L′) × correction factor (ii) Effect on Capacitance Let the capacitance of the circuit be C farads and E and I the instrument readings for voltage and current. Since the instruments read r.m.s. values, hence, as before, E =0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+........) 1m 3m 5m E 2 E 2 E HenceI 0.707 1m 3m 5m ..... 1/ C 1/3 C 1/5 C =0.707 (ωCE )2+(3ωCE )2+(5ωCE )2+.... 1m 3m 5m =0.707ωC E 2+9E 02+25E 2+..... 1m 3m sm I ∴ C= 0.707ω (E 2+9E 2+25E 2+....) 1m 3m 5m Again, we will multiply and divide the right-hand side E but in this case, we will write E in the numerator in its form [0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+....)] 1m 3m 5m ∴ C 1 0.707 (E 2 E 2 E 2 ......) 1m 3m 5m 0.707 E (E 2 9E 2 25E 2 .....) 1m 3m 5m 1 E 2 E 2 E 2..... 1 1 (E /E )2 (E /E )2..... 1m 3m 5m 3m 1m 5m 1m E E 2 9E 2 25E 2 ...... E 1 9(E /E )2 25(E /E )2 ..... 1m 3m 5m 3m 1m 5m 1m Again, if the effects of harmonics were neglected, the value of capacitance would appear to be I/ωE but its true value is less than this. For getting the true value, this apparent value will have to be multiplied by the quantity under the radical (which, therefore, is referred to as correction factor).* ∴ True capacitance (C) = Apparent capacitance (C′) × correction factor Example 20.14. A current of 50-Hz containing first, third and fifth harmonics of maximum values 100, 15 and 12 A respectively, is sent through an ammeter and an inductive coil of negligibly small resistance. A voltmeter connected to the terminals shows 75 V. What would be the current indicated by the ammeter and what is the exact value of the inductance of the coil in henrys ? * It may be noted that this correction factor is different from that in the case of pure inductance.Harmonics 771 Solution.

Harmonics in Different Three-phase Systems In tree-phase systems, harmonics may be produced in the same way as in single-phase systems. Hence, for all calculation they are treated in the same manner i.e. each harmonic is treated separately. Usually, even harmonics are absent in such systems. But care must be exercised when dealing with odd, especially, third harmonics and all multiples of 3rd harmonic (also called the triple-n harmonics).772 Electrical Technology (a) Expressions for Phase E.M.Fs. Let us consider a 3-phase alternator having identical phase windings (R, Y and B) in which harmonics are produced. The three phase e.m.fs. would be represented in their proper phase sequence by the equation. e =E (ωt+Ψ )+E (3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ )+..... R 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5 2 2 2 e E sin t E sin 3 t E sin 5 t Y 1m 3 1 3m 3 3 5m 3 5 4 4 4 e E sin t E sin 3 t E sin 5 t B 1m 3 1 3m 3 3 5m 3 5 On simplification, these become e =E sin(ωt+Ψ )+E (3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ )+..... – as before R 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5 2 10 e E sin t E sin(3 t 2 ) E sin 5 t ..... Y 1m 3 2 3m 3 5m 3 5 2 4 E 1m sin t 3 1 E 3m sin(3 t 3 ) E 5m sin 5 t 3 5 ..... 4 2 e E sin t E sin(3 t ) E sin 5 t ..... B 1m 3 1 3m 3 5m 3 5 From these expressions, it is clear that (i) All third harmonics are equal in all phases of the circuit i.e. they are in time phase. (ii) Fifth harmonics in the three phases have a negative phase sequence of R, B, Y because the fifth harmonic of blue phase reaches its maximum value before that in the yellow phase. (iii) All harmonics which are not multiples of three, have a phase displacement of 120º so that they can be dealt with in the usual manner. (iv) At any instant, all the e.m.fs. have the same direction which means that in the case of a Y-connected system they are directed either away from or towards the neutral point and in the case of Δ- connected system, they flow in the same direction. Main points can be summarized as below : (i) all triple-n harmonics i.e. 3rd, 9th, 15th etc. are in phase, (ii) the 7th, 13th and 19th harmonics have positive phase rotation of R, Y, B. (iii) the 5th, 11th and 17th harmonics have a negative phase sequence of R, B, Y. (b) Line Voltage for a Star-connected System In this system, the line voltages will be the difference between successive phase voltages and hence will contain no third harmonic terms because they, being identical in each phase, will cancel out. The fundamental will have a line voltage 3 times the phase voltage. Also, fifth harmonic has line voltage 3 its phase voltage. But it should be noted that in this case the r.m.s. value of the line voltage will be less than 3 times the r.m.s. value of the phase voltage due to the absence of third harmonic term from the line voltage. It can be proved that for any line voltage. E 2+E 2+E 2 Line value = 3 1 5 7 E 2+E 2+E 2+E 2 1 3 5 7Harmonics 773 where E , E etc. are r.m.s. values of the phase e.m.fs. 1 3 (c) Line Voltage for a Δ-connected System If the winding of the alternator are delta-connected, then the resultant e.m.f. acting round the closed mesh would be the sum of the phase e.m.fs. The sum of these e.m.fs. is zero for fundamental, 5th, 7th, 11th etc. harmonics. Since the third harmonics are in phase, there will be a resultant third harmonic e.m.f. of three times the phase value acting round the closed mesh. It will produce a circulating current whose value will depend on the impedance of the windings at the third harmonic frequency. It means that the third harmonic e.m.f. would be short-circuited by the windings with the result that there will be no third harmonic voltage across the lines. The same is applicable to all triple-n harmonic voltages. Obviously, the line voltage will be the phase voltage but without the triple-n terms. Example 20.16. A 3-φ generator has a generated e.m.f. of 230 V with 15 per cent third harmonic and 10 per cent fifth harmonic content. Calculate (i) the r.m.s. value of line voltage for Y-connection. (ii) the r.m.s. value of line voltage for Δ-connection. Solution. Let E , E , E be the r.m.s. values of the phase e.m.fs. Then 1 3 5 E = 0.15 E and E = 0.1 E 3 1 5 1 ∴ 230= E 2+(0.15E )2+(0.1E )2 1 1 1 E = 226 V ∴ E = 0.15 × 226 = 34 V and E = 0.1 × 226=22.6 V 1 3 5 (i) r.m.s. value of the fundamental line voltage = 3×226=392V r.m.s. value of third harmonic line voltage = 0 r.m.s. value of 5th harmonic line voltage 3×22.6= 39.2 V ∴ r.m.s. value of line voltage V = 3922+39.22 = 394 V L (ii) In Δ-connection, again the third harmonic would be absent from the line voltage ∴ r.m.s. value of line voltage V = 2262+22.62 =227.5 V L (d) Circulating Current in Δ-connected Alternator Let the three symmetrical phase e.m.fs. of the alternator be represented by the equations, e =E sin(ωt+Ψ )+E (3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ )+...... R 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5 e =E sin(ωt+Ψ −2π/3)+E sin(3ωt+Ψ )+E +sin(5ωt+Ψ −4π/3)..... Y 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5 e =E sin(ωt+Ψ −4π/3)+E sin(3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ −2π/3)+.... B 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5 The resultant e.m.f. acting round the Δ-connected windings of the armature is the sum of these e.m.fs. Hence it is given by e = e + e + e R Y B ∴ e=3E sin(3ωt+φ )+3E sin(9ωt+Ψ )+3E sin(15ωt+Ψ )+...... 3m 3 9m 9 15 15 If R and L represent respectively the resistance and inductance per phase of the armature winding, then the circulating current due to the resultant e.m.f. is given by 3E sin(3 t ) 3E sin(9 t ) 3E sin(15 t ) i 3m 3 9m 9 15m 15 .... i 3 (R2 9L2 2) 3 (R2 81L2 2) 3 (R2 225L2 2)774 Electrical Technology E sin(3ωt+Ψ ) E sin(9ωt+Ψ ) E sin(15ωt+Ψ ) = 3m 3 + 9m 9 + 15m 15 (R2+9L2ω2) (R2+81L2ω2) (R2+225L2ω2) The r.m.s. value of the current is given by I =0.707 [E 2/(R2+9L2ω2)+E 2/(R2+81L2ω2)+(E 2/(R2+225L2ω2)+......] C 3m 9m 15m (e) Three-phase four-wire System In this case, there will be no third harmonic component in line voltage. For the 4-wire system, each phase voltage (i.e. line to neutral) may contain a third harmonic component. If it is actually present, then current will flow in the Y-connected load. In case load is balanced, the resulting third harmonic line currents will all be in phase so that neutral wire will have to carry three times the third harmonic line current. There will be no current in the neutral wire either at fundamental frequency, or any harmonic frequency other than the triple-n frequency. 20.11. Harmonics in Single and 3-phase Transformers The flux density in transformer course is usually maintained at a fairly high value in order to keep the required volume of iron to the minimum. However, due to the non-linearity of magnetisation curve, some third harmonic distortion is always produced. Also, there is usually a small percentage of fifth harmonic. The magnetisation current drawn by the primary contains mainly third harmonic whose proportion depends on the size of the primary applied voltage. Hence, the flux is sinusoidal. In the case of three-phase transformers, the production of 3-phase current transformer harmonics will be affected by the method of connection and the type of construction employed. Δ (a) Primary Windings -CONNECTED Each primary phase can be considered as separately connected across the sinusoidal supply. (i) The core flux will be sinusoidal which means that magnetizing current will contain 3rd harmonic component in addition to relatively small amounts of other harmonics of higher order. (ii) In each phase, these third harmonic currents will be in phase and so produce a circulating current round the mesh with the result that there will be no third harmonic component in the line current. (b) Primary Winding Connected in 4-wire Star Each phase of the primary can again be considered as separately connected across a sinusoidal supply.Harmonics 775 (i) The flux in the transformer core would be sinusoidal and so would be the output voltage. (ii) The magnetizing current will contain 3rd harmonic component. This component being in phase in each winding will, therefore, return through the neutral wire. (c) Primary Windings Connected 3-wire Star Since there is no neutral wire, there will be no return path for the 3rd harmonic component of the magnetizing current. Hence, there will exist a condition of forced magnetization so that core flux must contain third harmonic component which is in phase in each limb of the transformer core. Although there will be a magnetic path for these fluxes in the case of shell type 3-phase transformer, yet in the case of three-limb core type transformer, the third harmonic component of the flux must return via the air. Because of the high reluctance magnetic path in such transformers, the third harmonic flux is reduced to a very small value. However, if the secondary of the transformer is delta-connected, then a third harmonic circulating current would be produced. This current would be in accordance with Lenz’s law tend to oppose the very cause producing it i.e. it would tend to minimize the third harmonic component of the flux. Should the third and fifth secondary be Y-connected, then provision of an additional Δ-connected winding, in which this current can flow, becomes necessary. This tertiary winding additionally served the purpose of preserving magnetic equilibrium of the transformer in the case of unbalanced loads. In this way, the output voltage from the secondary can be kept reasonably sinusoidal. Example 20.17. Determine whether the following two waves are of the same shape e = 10 sin (ωt + 30º) – 50 sin (3ωt – 60º) + 25 sin (5ωt + 40º) i = 1.0 sin (ωt – 60º) + 5 sin (3ωt – 150º) + 2.5 cos (5ωt – 140º) (Principles of Elect. Engg-II Jadavpur Univ.) Solution. Two waves possess the same waveshape (i) if they contain the same harmonics (ii) if the ratio of the corresponding harmonics to their respective fundamentals is the same (iii) if the harmonics are similarly spaced with respect to their fundamentals. In other words, (a) the ratio of the magnitudes of corresponding harmonics must be constant and (b) with fundamentals in phase, the corresponding harmonics of the two waves must be in phase. The test is applied first by checking the ratio of the corresponding harmonics and then coinciding the fundamentals by shifting one wave. If the phase angles of the corresponding harmonics are the same, then the two waves have the same shape. In the present case, condition (i) is fulfilled because the voltage and current waves contain the same harmonics, i.e. third and fifth. Secondly, the ratio of the magnitude of corresponding current and voltage harmonics is the same i.e. 1/10. Now, let the fundamental of the current wave be shifted ahead by 90º so that it is brought in phase with the fundamental of the voltage wave. It may be noted that the third and fifth harmonics of the current wave will be shifted by 3 × 90º = 270° and 5 × 90º = 450º respectively. Hence, the current wave becomes i′=1.0sin(ωt−60º+90º)+5sin(3ωt−150º+270º)+2.5cos(5ωt−140º+450º) =1.0sin(ωt+30º)+5sin(3ωt+120º)+2.5cos(5ωt+310º)776 Electrical Technology =1.0sin(ωt+30º)−5sin(3ωt−60º)+2.5sin(5ωt+40º) It is seen that now the corresponding harmonics of the voltage and current waves are in phase. Since all conditions are fulfilled, the two waves are of the same waveshape. Tutorial Problem No. 20.1 Ω 1.

Periodic Functions A function f (t) is said to be periodic if f(t+T)= f(t) for all values of t where T is some positive number. This T is the interval between two successive repetitions and is called the period of f (t). A sine wave having a period of T =2π/ω is a common example of periodic function. 21.3. Trigonometric Fourier Series Suppose that a given function f (t) satisfies the following conditions (known as Dirichlet conditions): 1. f (t) is periodic having a period of T. 2. f (t) is single-valued everywhere. 3. In case it is discontinuous, f (t) has a finite number of discontinuities in any one period. 4. f (t) has a finite number of maxima and minima in any one period. The function f(t) may represent either a voltage or current waveform. According to Fourier theorem, this function f (t) may be represented in the trigonometric form by the infinite series. f(t)=a +a cosω t+a cos2ω t+a cos3ω t+...+a cosnω t 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 n 0 + b sinω t+b sin2ω t+b sin3ω t+...+b sinnω t 1 0 2 0 3 0 n 0 ∞ ∑ = a + (a cosnω t+b sinnω t) 0 n 0 n 0 n=1 ...

Also, 2 /T 2 f where f is the fundamental frequency. 0 0 0 It is seen from the above Fourier Series that the periodic function consists of sinusoidal components of frequency 0, ω ,2ω ....nω . This representation of the function f(t) is in the 0 0 0 frequency domain. The first component a with zero frequency is called the dc component. The 0 sine and cosine terms represent the harmonics. The number n represents the order of the harmonics. When n = 1, the component (a cosω t+b sinω t) is called the first harmonic or the 1 0 1 0 fundamental component of the waveform. When n = 2, the component (a cos2ω t+b sin2ω t) is called the second harmonic of the 2 0 2 0 waveform. The nth harmonic of the waveform is represented by (a cosnω t+b sinnω t). It has a n 0 n 0 frequency of nω i.e. n times the frequency of the fundamental component. 0 21.4. Alternate Forms of Trigonometric Fourier Series Eq.

(ii) Find the value of a by multiplying both sides of the expression for Fourier series by n cos nθ and then integrating it between limits 0 to 2π or 0 to T or – T/2 to T/2 or t to (t + T). 1 1 z z 1 2π 1 2π ∴ a = f(θ)cosnθdθ=2× f(θ)cosnθdθ n π 0 2π 0 Since π = T/2, we have z z z 2 T 2πn 2 T/2 2πn 2 t +T 2πn a n = T 0 f(t)cos T tdt= T −T/2 f(t)cos T tdt= T t 1 f(t)cos T tdt 1 z z z 2 T 2 T/2 2 t +T = f(t)cosnω tdt= f(t)cosnω tdt= 1 f(t)cosnω tdt T 0 0 T −T/2 0 T t 0 1 = 2 × average value of f(θ)cosnθ over one cycle of the fundamental.Fourier Series 785 Values of a , a , a etc. can be found from above by putting n = 1, 2, 3 etc. 1 2 3 (iii) Similarly, find the value of b by multiplying both sides of Fourier series by sin nθ and n integrating it between the limits 0 to 2πor 0 to T or – T/2 to T/2 or t to (t + T). z z 1 1 1 2π 1 2π ∴ b = f(θ)sinnθ=2× f(θ)sinnθdθ n π 0 2π 0 z z z 2 T 2πn 2 T/2 2πn 2 t +T 2πn = f(t)sin tdt= f(t)sin tdt= 1 f(t)sin tdt T 0 T T −T/2 T T t t 1 z z z 2 T 2 T/2 2 t +T = f(t)sin nω tdt= f(t)sinnω tdt= 1 f(t)sinnω tdt T 0 0 T −T/2 0 T t 0 1 2πn = 2 × average value of f (θ) sin nθ of f (t) sin torf(t) sin nω t over one cycle of T 0 the fundamental. Values of b , b , b etc. can be found from above by putting n = 1, 2, 3 etc. 1 2 3 21.7. Different Types of Functional Symmetries A non-sinusoidal wave can have the following types of symmetry: 1. Even Symmetry The function f (t) is said to possess even symmetry if f (t) = f (– t). It means that as we travel equal amounts in time to the left and right of the origin (i.e. along the + X-axis and –X-axis), we find the function to have the same value. For example in Fig.21.2(a), points A and B are equidistant from point O. Here the two function values are equal and positive. At points C and D, the two values of the function are again equal, though negative. Such a function is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis. Examples of even function are: t2, Fig. 21.2786 Electrical Technology cos 3t, sin2 5t (2 + t2 + t4) and a constant A because the replacement of t by (– t) does not change the value of any of these functions. For example, cosωt=cos(−ωt). This type of symmetry can be easily recognised graphically because mirror symmetry exists about the vertical or f (t) axis. The function shown in Fig. 21.2 has even symmetry because when folded along vertical axis, the portions of the graph of the function for positive and negative time fit exactly, one on top of the other. The effect of the even symmetry on Fourier series is that the constant b = 0 i.e. the wave has n no sine terms. In general, b , b , b ... b = 0. The Fourier series of an even function contains only 1 2 3 n a constant term and cosine terms i.e. ∑ ∞ ∑ ∞ 2πn f(t)=a + a cosnω t=a + a cos t 0 n 0 0 n T n=1 n=1 The value of a may be found by integrating over any half-period. z n z 2 π 4 T/2 ∴ a = f(θ)cosnθdθ= f(t)cosnωtdt n π 0 T 0 2. Odd Symmetry A function f (t) is said to possess odd symmetry if f(−t)=−f(t). It means that as we travel an equal amount in time to the left or right from the origin, we find the function to be the same except for a reversal in sign. For example, in Fig. 21.3 the two points A and B are equidistant from point O. The two function values at A and B are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. In other words, if we replace t by (– t), we obtained the negative of the given function. The X-axis divides an odd function into two halves with equal areas above and below the X-axis. Hence, a = 0. 0 Examples of odd functions are: t, sin t, t cos 50 t(t+t3+t5)andt (1+t2) A sine function is an odd function because sin (−ωt)=−sinωt . Fig. 21.3 An odd function has symmetry about the origin rather than about the f(t) axis which was the case for an even function. The effect of odd symmetry on a Fourier series is that it contains no constant term or consine term. It means that a = 0 and a = 0 i.e. a , a , a ....a = 0. The Fourier 0 n 1 2 3 n series expansion contains only sine terms. ∞ ∑ ∴ f(t)= b sinnω t n 0 n=1 The value of b may be found by integrating over any half-period. nFourier Series 787 z z 2 π 4 T/2 ∴ b = f(θ)sinnθdθ= f(t)sinnωtdt n π 0 T 0 3. Half-wave Symmetry or Mirror-Symmetry or Rotational Symmetry A function f (t) is said to possess half-wave symmetry if f(t)=−f(t±T/2)or−f(t)= f(t±T/2). It means that the function remains the same if it is shifted to the left or right by half a period and then flipped over (i.e. multiplied by – 1) in respect to the t-axis or horizontal axis. It is called mirror symmetry because the negative portion of the wave is the mirror image of the positive portion of the wave displaced horizontally a distance T/2. In other words, a waveform possesses half symmetry only when we invert its negative half- cycle and get an exact duplicate of its positive half-cycle. For example, in Fig. 21.4 (a) if we invert the negative half-cycle, we get the dashed ABC half-cycle which is exact duplicate of the positive half-cycle. Same is the case with the waveforms of Fig. 21.4 (b) and Fig. 21.4 (c). In case Fig. 21.4 of doubt, it is helpful to shift the inverted half-cycle by a half-period to the left and see if it super- imposes the positive half-cycle. If it does so, there exists half-wave symmetry otherwise not. It is seen that the waveform of Fig. 21.4 (d) does not possess half-wave symmetry. It is so because when its negative half-cycle is inverted and shifted by half a period to the left it does not superimpose the positive half-cycle. It may be noted that half-wave symmetry may be present in a waveform which also shows either odd symmetry or even symmetry: For example, the square waveform shown in Fig. 21.4 (a) possesses even symmetry whereas the triangular waveform of Fig. 24.4 (b) has odd symmetry. All cosine and sine waves possess half- wave symmetry because F I F I F I F I 2πG TJ G2π J 2π 2πG TJ G2π J 2π cos Ht± K =cosH t±πK =−cos t;sin Ht± K =sinH t±πK =−sin t T 2 T T T 2 T T It is worth noting that the Fourier series of any function which possesses half-wave symmetry has zero average value and contains only odd harmonics and is given by788 Electrical Technology ∑ ∞ F G 2πn 2πn I J ∑ ∞ ∑ ∞ f(t)= Ha cos t+b sin tK = (a cosnω t+b sinnω t)= (a cosnθ+b sinnθ) n T n T n 0 n 0 n n n=1 n=1 n=1 odd odd odd z z 4 T/2 2πn 2 π where, a = f(t)cos dt= f(θ)cosnθdθ ... n odd n T 0 T π 0 z z 4 T/2 2πn 2 π b = f(t)sin dt= f(θ)sinnθdθ ... n odd n T 0 T π 0 4. Quarter-wave Symmetry An odd or even function with rotational symmetry is said to possess quarter-wave symmetry. Fig. 21.5 (a) possesses half-wave symmetry as well as odd symmetry. The wave shown in Fig. 21.5 (b) has both half-wave symmetry and even symmetry. The mathematical test for quarter-wave symmetry is as under: Odd quarter-wave f(t)=−f(t+T/2)andf(−t)=−f(t) Even quarter-wave f(t)=−f(t+T/2)andf(t)= f(−t) Fig. 21.5 Since each quarter cycle is the same in a way having quarter-wave symmetry, it is sufficient to integrate over one quarter period i.e. from 0 to T/4 and then multiply the result by 4. (i) If f(t) or f(θ) is odd and has quarter-wave symmetry, then a is 0 and a is 0. Hence, the 0 n Fourier series will contain only odd sine terms. ∴ f(t)=∑ ∞ b sin 2πnt or f(θ)=∑ ∞ b sinnθ, whereb = 1∫2π f(θ)sinnθdθ n=1 n T n=1 n n π 0 odd odd It may be noted that in the case of odd quarter-wave symmetry, the integration may be carried over a quarter cycle. z 4 π/2 ∴ a = f(θ)cosnθdθ ... n odd n π 0 z 8 T/4 = f(t)sinnωtdt ... n odd T 0 (ii) If f(t) or f(θ) is even and, additionally, has quarter-wave symmetry, then a is 0 and b 0 n is 0. Hence, the Fourier series will contain only odd cosine terms.Fourier Series 789 z ∞ ∞ ∑ ∑ 1 2π ∴ f(θ)= a cosnθdθ= a cosnω tdt;wherea = f(θ)cosnθdθ n n 0 n π 0 n=1 n=1 odd odd In this case a may be found by integrating over any quarter period. z n 4 π/2 a = f(θ)sinnθdθ ... n odd n π 0z 8 T/4 = f(t)cosnωtdt ... n odd T 0 21.8. Line or Frequency Spectrum A plot which shows the amplitude of each frequency component in a complex waveform is called the line spectrum or frequency spectrum (Fig. 21.6). The amplitude of each frequency component is indicated by the length of the vertical line located at the corresponding frequency. Since the spectrum represents frequencies of the harmonics as discrete lines of appropriate height, it is also called a discrete spectrum. The lines decrease rapidly for waves having convergent series. Waves with discontinuities such as the sawtooth and square waves have spectra whose amplitudes decrease slowly because their series have strong high harmonics. On the other hand, the line spectra of waveforms without discontinuities and with a smooth appearance have lines Fig. 21.6 which decrease in height very rapidly. The harmonic content and the line spectrum of a wave represent the basic nature of that wave and never change irrespective of the method of analysis. Shifting the zero axis changes the symmetry of a given wave and gives its trigonometric series a completely different appearance but the same harmonics always appear in the series and their amplitude remains constant. Fig. 21.7 Fig. 21.7 shows a smooth wave alongwith its line spectrum. Since there are only sine terms in its trigonometric series (apart from a =π), the harmonic amplitudes are given by b . 0 n790 Electrical Technology 21.9. Procedure for Finding the Fourier Series of a Given Function It is advisable to follow the following steps: 1. Step No. 1 If the function is defined by a set of equations, sketch it approximately and examine for symmetry. 2. Step No. 2 Whatever be the period of the given function, take it as 2π (Ex. 20.6) and find the Fourier series in the form f(θ)=a +a cosθ+a cos2θ+...+a cosnθ+b sinθ+b sin2θ+...+b sinnθ 0 1 2 n 1 2 n 3.

Step No. 4 If there is no symmetry, then a is found as above whereas the other two fourier constants can 0 be found by the relation. z z 1 2π 1 π a = f(θ)cosnθdθ= f(θ)cosnθdθ n π 0 π −π z z 2π 1 π b = f(θ)sinnθdθ= f(θ)sinnθdθ n 0 π −π 5. Step No. 5 If the function has even symmetry i.e. f(θ)= f(−θ), then b = 0 so that the Fourier series n will have no sine terms.

Step No. 6 If the given function has odd symmetry i.e. f(−θ)=−f(θ) then a = 0 and a = 0. Hence, 0 n there would be no cosine terms in the Fourier series which accordingly would be given by ∞ z z f(θ)= ∑ b n sinω 0 t; where b n = π 1 2π f(θ)sinnθdθ= π 2 π f(θ)sinnθdθ n=1 0 0 7. Step No. 7 If the function possesses half-wave symmetry i.e. f(θ)=−f(θ±π) or f(t)=−f(t±T/2), then a is 0 and the Fourier series contains only odd harmonics.

Wave Analyzer A wave analyzer is an instrument designed to measure the individual amplitude of eachharmonic Fig. 21.8 component in a complex waveform. It is the simplest form of analysis in the frequency domain and can be performed with a set of tuned filters and a voltmeter. That is why such analyzers are also called frequency-selective voltmeters. Since such analyzers sample the frequency spectrum successively, i.e. one after the other, they are called non-real-time analyzers. The block diagram of a simple wave analyzer is shown in Fig. 21.8. It consists of a tunable fundamental frequency selector that detects the fundamental frequency f which is 1 the lowest frequency contained in the input waveform. Once tuned to this fundamental frequency, a selective harmonic filter enables switching to multiples of f . After amplification, the output 1 is fed to an a.c. voltmeter, a recorder and a Wave analyzer frequency counter. The voltmeter reads the r.m.s amplitude of the harmonic wave, the recorder traces its waveform and the frequency counter gives its frequency. The line spectrum of the harmonic component can be plotted from the above data. For higher frequencies (MHz) heterodyne wave analyzers are generally used. Here, the input complex wave signal is heterodyned to a higher intermediate frequency (IF) by an internal local oscillator. The output of the IF amplifier is rectified and is applied to a dc voltmeter called heterodyned tuned voltmeter.794 Electrical Technology The block diagram of a wave analyzer using the heterodyning principle is shown in Fig. 21.9. Fig. 21.9 The signal from the internal, variable-frequency oscillator heterodynes with the input signal in a mixer to produce output signal having frequencies equal to the sum and difference of the oscillator frequency f and the input frequency f . Generally, the bandpass filter is tuned to the ’sum 0 1 frequency’ which is allowed to pass through. The signal coming out of the filter is amplified, rectified and then applied to a dc voltmeter having a decibel-calibrated scale. In this way, the peak amplitudes of the fundamental component and other harmonic components can be calculated. 21.11. Spectrum Analyzer It is a real-time instrument i.e. it simultaneously displays on a CRT, the harmonic peak Fig. 21.10 values versus frequency of all wave components in the frequency range of the analyzer. The block diagram of such an analyzer is shown in Fig. 21.10. As seen, the spectrum analyzer uses a CRT in combination with a narrow-band superheterodyne receiver. The receiver is tuned by varying the frequency of the voltage-tuned variable-frequency oscillator which also controls the sawtooth generator that sweeps the horizontal time base of the Spectrum analyzer CRT deflection plates. As the oscillator isFourier Series 795 swept through its frequency band by the sawtooth generator, the resultant signal mixes and beats with the input signal to produce an intermediate frequency (IF) signal in the mixer. The mixer output occurs only when there is a corresponding harmonic component in the input signal which matches with the sawtooth generator signal. The signals from the IF amplifier are detected and further amplified before applying them to the vertical deflection plates of the CRT. The resultant output displayed on the CRT represents the line spectrum of the input complex or nonsinusoidal waveform. 21.12. Fourier Analyzer A Fourier analyzer uses digital signal processing technique and provides information regarding the contents of a complex wave which goes beyond the capabilities of a spectrum analyzer. These analyzers are based on the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform using an algorithm called the fast Fourier transformer. This algorithm calculates the amplitude and phase of each harmonic component from a set of time domain samples of the input complex wave signal. Fig. 21.11 A basic block diagram of a Fourier analyzer is shown in Fig. 21.11. The complex wave signal applied to the instrument is first filtered to remove out-of-band frequency components. Next, the signal is applied to an analog/digital (A/D) convertor which samples and digitizes it at regular time intervals until a full set of samples (called a time record) has been collected. The microprocessor then performs a series of computations on the time data to obtain the frequency-domain results i.e. amplitude versus frequency relationships. These results which are stored in memory can be displayed on a CRT or recorded permanently with a recorder or plotter. Fourier Analyzer Since Fourier analyzers are digital instruments, they can be easily interfaced with a computer or other digital systems. Moreover, as compared to spectrum analyzers, they provide a higher degree of accuracy, stability and repeatability. 21.13. Harmonic Synthesis It is the process of building up the shape of a complex waveform by adding the instantaneous values of the fundamental and harmonics. It is a graphical procedure based on the knowledge of the different components of a complex waveform.796 Electrical Technology Example 21.1. A complex voltage waveform contains a fundamental voltage of r.m.s. value 220 V and frequency 50 Hz alongwith a 20% third harmonic which has a phase angle lagging by 3π/4 radian at t = 0. Find an expression representing the instantaneous complex voltage v. Using harmonic synthesis, also sketch the complex waveform over one cycle of the fundamental. Solution. The maximum value of the fundamental voltage is = 200× 2 = 310 V. Its angular velocity is ω =2π×50 = 100π rad/s. Hence, the fundamental voltage is represented by 310 sin 100πt. The amplitude of the third harmonic = 20% of 310 = 62V. Its frequency is 3 × 50 = 150 Hz. Hence, its angular frequency is = 2π×150=300π rad/s. Accordingly, the third harmonic voltage can be represented by the equation 62 sin (300πt−3π/4). The equation of the complex voltage is given by υ = 310 sin 100πt+62sin(300πt−3π/4). Fig 21.12 In Fig. 21.12 are shown one cycle of the fundamental and three cycles of the third harmonic component initially lagging by 3π/4 radian or 135°. By adding ordinates at different intervals, the complex voltage waveform is built up as shown. Incidentally, it would be seen that if the negative half-cycle is reversed, it is identical to the positive half-cycle. This is a feature of waveforms possessing half-wave symmetry which contains the fundamental and odd harmonics. Example 21.2. For the nonsinusoidal wave shown in Fig. 21.13, determine (a) Fourier coefficients a , a and b and (b) frequency of the fourth harmonic if the wave has a period of 0.02 0 3 4 second. Solution. The function f(θ) has a constant value from θ = 0 to θ = 4π/3 radian and 0 value from θ=4π/3 radian to θ=2π radian.

Find the Fourier series of the “half sinusoidal” voltage waveform which represents the output of a half-wave rectifier. Sketch its line spectrum. Solution. As seen from Fig. 21.14 (a), T = 0.2 second, f = 1/T = 1/0.2 = 5 Hz and 0 ω = 2 f = 10π rad/s. Moreover, the function has even symmetry. Hence, the Fourier series 0 0 will contain no sine terms because b = 0. n The limits of integration would not be taken from t = 0 to t = 0.2 second, but from t = – 0.5 to t = 0.15 second in order to get fewer equations and hence fewer integrals.

Find the trigonometric Fourier series for the square voltage waveform shown in Fig. 21.17(a) and sketch the line spectrum. Solution. The function shown in Fig. 21.17 (a) is an odd function because at any time f(– t) = – f (t). Hence, its Fourier series will contain only sine terms i.e. a = 0. The function also n possesses half-wave symmetry, hence, it will contain only odd harmonics.

By inspection, we know that the average value of the wave is zero over a cycle because the height of the curve below and above the X-axis is the same hence, a = 0.

The gadget shown in the above picture is claimed to protect the equipment against such surges or spikes816 Electrical Technology 22.1. Introduction It is quite an easy job to calculate the steady current, which flows in a circuit, when it is connected to a d.c. generator or a battery. Similarly, the alternating current which flows in a circuit when connected to an alternator can also be calculated by the various method discussed in Chapters 13 and 14. These currents are known as steady currents because in such cases, it is assumed that (i) the circuit components are constant and (ii) the circuit has been connected to the generator long enough for any disturbance produced on initial switching, to resolve itself. In general, transients disturbances are produced whenever (a) an apparatus or circuit is suddenly connected to or disconnected from the supply, (b) a circuit is shorted and (c) there is a sudden change in the applied voltage from one finite value to another. We will now discuss the transients produced whenever different circuits are suddenly switched on or off from the supply voltage. In each case, we will assume that the resultant current consists of two parts (i) a final steady-stage or normal current and (ii) a transient current superimposed on the steady-stage current. It is essential to remember that the transient currents are not driven by any part of the applied voltage but are entirely associated with the changes in the stored energy in inductors and capacitors. Since there is no stored energy in resistors, there are no transients in pure resistive circuits. 22.2. Types of Transients There are single-energy transients and double-energy transients. Single-energy transients are those in which only one form of energy, either electromagnetic or electrostatic is involved as in R-L and R-C circuits. However, double-energy transients are those in which both electromagnetic or electrostatic is involved as in R-L-C circuits Transient disturbances may be further classified as follows : (a) Initiation Transients : These are produced when a circuit, which is originally dead, is energised. (b) Subsidence Transients : These are produced when an energised circuit is rapidly de-energised and reaches an eventual steady-stage of zero current or voltage, as in the case of short-circuiting an R-L or R-C circuit suddenly. (c) Transition Transients : These are due to sudden but energetic changes from one steady state to another. (d) Complex Transients : These are produced in a circuit which is simultaneously subjected to two transients due to two independent disturbances or when the disturbing force producing the transients is itself variable. (e) Relaxation Transients : In these transients, the transition occurs cyclically towards states, which when reached, become unstable themselves. A distinction may also be made between free and forced transients which are produced due to the applied voltage being itself transient. 22.3. Important Differential Equations Some of the important differential equations, used in the treatment of single and double energy transients, are given below. We will consider both first-order and second-order differential equations.Transients 817 1. First Order Equations dy (i) Let +ay=0 where a is a constant. dx Its solution is y = k e–ax where k is the constant of integration whose value can be found from the boundary conditions i.e. conditions prevalent at the instant when the voltage to a circuit is applied or excluded. (ii) If dy +ay=b where a and b are constants, then solution is y= b +ke −ax dx a The value of k can again be found from boundary conditions. dy (iii) If +Ay=B dx where A and B are not constants but are functions of x, then the solution is given by y e A dx e A dx Bdx ke A dx If A = a = constant, then the above equation simplifies to y e ax eax Bdx ke ax 2. Second Order Equations d2y dy (i) Suppose +a +by=0where a and b are constants, then the solution is dx2 dx y k e 2 x k e 2 x 1 2 where λ and λ are constants of integration and whose values are, 1 2 a a2 a a2 b and b 1 2 4 2 2 4 (a) If a2/4 > b, the roots are real and the above solution can be applied without any difficulty. (b) If a2/4 < b, the radicals contain a negative quantity. In that-case, the solution is given by −1 ax y=e 2 (k sinλ x+k cosλ x) 3 0 4 0 where k and k are the new constants of integration and 3 4 a2 λ = b− 0 4 (c) If a2/4 = b, then both roots are equal and each is = – a/2. Hence, in this case, the solution becomes y=k e λt +k t.e λt 5 6 d2y dy (ii) Let +a +by=c dx2 dx where a, b and c are constant. In this case also, the solution will again depend on the root as discussed above. y k e 1x k e x c/b 1 2 2 (iii) (a) Let the differential equation be given by d2y dy +a +by=u dx2 dx818 Electrical Technology where a, b are c are constants but u is a particular function of the variable x. The solution of such an equation consists of a particular integral and a complementary function. (b) Let y be a sinusoidal function of x, then d2y dy +a +by=csinωt dx2 dx In this case, particular integral is y c cos x tan 1 2 b 1 a2 2 ( 2 b)2 a The complementary function is given by y ke 1 x k e 2 x where a a2 b and a a2 b 2 1 2 1 2 4 2 2 4 The complete solution for the above equation is y = y + y 1 2 Further treatment is the same as for case 2 (i) above. 22.4. Transients in R-L Circuits (D.C.) If i, I and i be the resultant current, steady-state current and transient current respectively in s t R–L circuit of Fig. 22.1 (a), then by superimposition, the equation for the resultant current, for the duration of initiation transient, is Fig. 22.1 i = I + i s t ... (i) Since the applied voltage V drives the steady-state current, hence I = V/R s Since the transient current i is not associated with any voltage, t di ∴ iR L t 0 t dt ... (ii) di R or t dt ... (iii) dt L or di t R dt ∴ logh i R t K * i L t L t ... (iv) where K is the constant of integration whose value may be found from the initial conditions. Now when t = 0, i = I (say). Then from Eq. (iv) above we get, logh I = 0 + K t 0 0 * log x is written as logh x. Obviously, logh x = 2.3 log x. e 10Transients 819 Putting this value of K in Eq. (iv), we have R R t loghi logh I t or logh i /I t t 0 L t 0 L ∴ i =I e −t/λ ... (v) t 0 where λ=L/R is called the time-constant of the circuit. Its reciprocal R/L is called the damping coefficient of the circuit. The current decreases exponentially as shown in Fig. 22.1 (b). From Eq. (i) and (v), we have i=I +I e −t/λ ... (vi) s 0 If the time is reckoned when the voltage V is applied, so that when t = 0, i = 0, then from equation (vi), we get 0=I +i e −0=I +I ∴ I =−I =− V s 0 s 0 0 s R In that case, Eq. (vi) becomes i= V − V e −t/λ ... (vii) R R = V (1−e −t/λ ) ... (viii) R Curves for I and i have been plotted in Fig. 22.1 (b). The curve for resultant current has been s t obtained by the superposition of steady-state current I (= V/R) and transient current s i = V e −t/λ t R Theoretically, the transient current i takes infinite t time to die off but, in practice, it disappears in a very short time. The values of resultant, steady-state and transient voltages across the resistor can be found by multiplying Eq. (vii) by R and are shown in Fig. 22.2. The e.m.f. of self-induction–Ldi/dt is only transient in nature and equals t i R as seen from Eq. (ii) above. Fig. 22.2 t 22.5. Short Circuit Current After some time, the transient current would disappear and the only current flowing in the circuit would be the steady-state current I = V/R. Let s the R-L circuit be closed upon itself i.e. be short-circuited by shifting the switch [Fig. 22.1 (a)] to position 2. Since the voltage V has been excluded from the circuit, the trapped current I s will immediately cease to be a steady- state current, but on the other hand, will become the initial value I of a 0 new subsidence transient current i. t Large-capacity short-circuit current generator820 Electrical Technology If time is measured at the instant of short-circuit, so that when t = 0, the current is I = V/R, then s Eq. (v) becomes i = V e −t/λ ... (ix) t R This equation has been plotted in Fig. 22.3. The only voltage acting in the circuit is that due to self-induction i.e. – L di/dt which equals iR. t t 22.6. Time Constant The time constant of a circuit is defined as the time it would take for the transient current to decrease to zero, if the Fig. 22.3 decrease were linear instead of being exponential. In other words, it is the time during which the transient current would have decreased to zero, had it maintained its initial rate of decrease. The initial rate of decrease can be found by differentiating Eq. (vi) and putting t = 0 ∴ d d i t t = I λ 0 e −t/λ d d i t t t 0 I 0 If the rate of decrease were constant throughout and equal to −I /λ, then the straight line 0 showing the relation between i and t would be given by t I i =− 0 t t λ The time-period would be equal to the sub-tangent OT drawn to the exponential curve of Fig. 22.3 at i = I i.e. at the beginning of the curve. t 0 If we put t =λ in Eq. (v), then i = I e–1 = I /e = I /2.718 = 0.37 I t 0 0 0 0 Hence, time period of a circuit is the time during which the transient current decreases to 0.37 of its initial value. Example 22.1. A coil having a resistance of 30 ω and an inductance of 0.09 H is connected across a battery of 20 V. Plot the current and its two components. Assume that t = 0 when the circuit is completed. (Electromechanic Allahabad Univ. 1992) Fig. 22.4 Solution. The two components of the circuit current are (i) steady current I = V/R = 20/30 s = 2/3 A = 667 mA and (ii) Transient current i =−(V/R)e −t/λ . tTransients 821 Total current is i=I +i . Let us find the value of transient current after various time s t intervals. In the present case, λ= L/R=0.09/30=0.003 second = 3 millisecond. The values of i and i at various times are tabulated below. Value of i = I + i t s t t e −t/λ i i t e −t/λ i i t t (ms) (mA) (ms) (mA) 0.0 1.000 –667 0 2.5 0.435 –290 377 0.5 0.847 –565 102 3.0 0.368 –244 423 1.0 0.716 –477 190 3.5 0.311 –208 459 1.5 0.606 –405 262 4.0 0.264 –176 491 2.0 0.514 -344 323 4.5 0.223 –148 519 It is seen that whereas transient current decreases exponentially, total circuit current increases exponentially as expected (Fig. 22.4). Example 22.2. A circuit of resistance 10 Ω and inductance 0.1 H in series has a direct voltage of 200 V suddenly applied to it. Find the voltage drop across the inductance at the instant of switching on and at 0.01 second. Find also the flux-linkages at these instants. (Basic Electricity, Bombay Univ.) Solution. (i) Switching instant At the instant of switching on, i = 0, so that iR = 0 hence all applied voltage must drop across the inductance only. Therefore, voltage drop across inductance = 200 V. Since at this instant i = 0, there are no flux-linkages of the coil. (ii) When t = 0.01 second As time passes, current grows so that the applied voltage is partly dropped across the resistance and partly across the coil. Let us first find iR drop for which purpose, we need the value of i at t = 0.01 second. Now, time period of the circuit is λ = L/R = 0.1/10 = 0.01 second. Since the given time happens to be equal to time constant, ∴ i = (200/10) × 0.632 = 12.64 A; iR = 152.64 × 10 = 126.4 V Drop across inductance = 2002−126.42 = 155 V Now, L = N Φ/i or NΦ=Li ∴ Flux-linkages Li = 0.1 × 12.64 = 1.264 Wb-turns. Example 22.3. A coil of 10 H inductance and 5Ω resistance is connected in parallel with a 20 Ω resistor across a 100-V d.c. supply which is suddenly disconnected. Find (a) the initial rate of change of current after switching. (b) the voltage across the 20 Ω resistor initially and after 0.3 s. (c) the voltage across the switch contacts at the instant of separation and (d) the rate at which the coil is losing stored energy 0.3 second after switching. Solution. (a) Since the steady-state current is zero, i=I e −t/λ 0 Now, when t = 0, current is = 100/5 = 20 A. It means the current flowing through the coil immediately before opening the switch is 20 A.822 Electrical Technology ∴ I = 20 A 0 Hence, the above equation becomes i=20e −t/λ Now λ=L/R=10/25=1/2.5 ∴ i=20e −2.5t d d t i ( 20 2.5e 2.5t) t 0 – 50 A/s t 0 The negative sign merely shows that the current is decreasing. (b) After the supply has been disconnected, the current through the 20-Ω resistor is i since it is in series with the coil. Initial p.d. across the 20Ω resistor = (current at t = 0) × 20 = 20 × 20 = 400 V Current through the resistor after 0.3 second = 20e −2.5×0.3 =9.45A ∴ Voltage across the resistor after 0.3 second = (current at t = 0.3 second) × 20 = 9.45 × 20 = 189 V (c) The e.m.f. induced in the coil at break tends to maintain the current through it in the original direction. Hence, the direction of the current through 20 Ω resistor is upwards so that the p.d. across the switch contacts will be the sum of supply voltage and the voltage across 20Ω resistor. ∴ Initial voltage across switch contacts = 400 + 100 = 500 V (d) The rate of loss of energy = power = induced e.m.f. in coil × current (after 0.3 s) di L (after 0.3 second) dt t 0.3 Now, after 0.3 second, i = 9.45 A Value of di/dt after 0.3 second = – 20 × 2.5 × e–0.75 = – 23.6 A/second ∴ Rate of loss of energy = – 10 × 23.6 × 9.45 = – 2,230 joule/second 22.7. Transients in R-L Circuits (A.C.) Let a voltage given by v = V sin (ωt+Ψ) be suddenly applied across an R-L circuit [Fig. m 22.5 (a)] at a time when t = 0. It means that the voltage is applied when it is passing through the value V sin Ψ. Since the contact may be closed at any point of the cycle, angle Ψ may have any m value lying between zero and 2π radians. The resultant current, as before, is given by i = i + i s t Fig. 22.5Transients 823 The value of steady-state current is found by the normal circuit theory. The peak steady-state current is given by V V I = m = m m R2+X 2 Z L where R2+X 2 is the impedance of the circuit. This current lags behind the applied voltage by L an angle φ such that tan φ = X /R or φ = tan–1 (X /R) L L Hence, the equation for the instantaneous value of the steady-state current becomes i =I sin(ωt+Ψ−φ) s m As before, the transient current is given by i =I e −t/λ ∴i=I sin(ωt+Ψ−φ)+I e −t/λ ... (i) t 0 m 0 Now, when t = 0, i = 0, hence putting these values in Eq. (i) above, we get 0=I sin(Ψ−φ)+I ∴I =−I sin(Ψ−φ) m 0 0 m Hence Eq. (i) can be written as i=I sin(ωt+Ψ−φ)−I sin(Ψ−φ)e −t/λ ... (ii) m m From the above, it is seen that the value of I and hence the size of the transient current 0 depends on angle Ψ i.e. it depends on the instant in the cycle at which the circuit is closed. We will consider the following three cases : Case 1 When t = 0, let the voltage pass through its zero value and become positive i.e. let Ψ=0. In that case, putting this value of Ψ in Eq. (ii), we get i=I sin(ωt−φ)−I sin(−φ)e −t/λ =I [sin(ωt−φ)+sinφe −t/λ ] m m m This is shown in Fig. 22.5 (b). It is seen that maximum instantaneous peak current OB is larger than the normal peak current OA. Case 2 Let t = 0 when voltage is passing through its value V sin (φ) so that Ψ=φor Ψ−φ=0 m In that, I = 0, there is no transient current at the time of switching on (i.e. i = 0 ). It 0 t corresponds to the contacts closing at the instant when the steady state current itself is zero. Case 3 When t = 0, let the voltage be passing through V sin i.e. and /2 m 2 2 In this case, the transient [as found from Eq. (ii)] would be given by i I sin .e t/ I e t/ t m 2 m Under these conditions, the transient would have its maximum possible initial value. Example 22.4. A 1.0 H choke has a resistance of 50 Ω. This choke is supplied with an a.c. voltage given by e = 141 sin 314 t. Find the expression for the transient component of the current flowing through the choke after the voltage is suddenly switched on. (Principles of Elect. Engg-II, Jadavpur Univ.) Solution. The equation of the transient component of the current is (Art. 22.7 Case 1)824 Electrical Technology i =I sinφe −t/λ t m Here, λ= L/R = 1/50 = 0.02 second ; Z = 50 + j 314 = 318 ∠80.95º I = V /Z = 141/318 = 0.443 A; sin 80.95º = 0.9875 m m ∴ i = 0.443 × 0.9875 e–t/0.02 = 0.4376e–t/0.02 t Example 22.5. A 50-Hz sinusoidal voltage of maximum value of 400 V is applied to a series circuit of resistance 10 Ω and inductance 0.1 H. Find tan expression for the value of the current at any instant after the voltage is applied, assuming that voltage is zero at the instant of application. Calculate its value 0.02 second after switching on (Electric Circuit, Punjab Univ. 1990) Solution. In such cases, as seen from Art. 22.7 (Case 1), the current consists of a steady-state component and a transient component. The equation of the resultant current is i=I sin(ωt−φ) + I sinφet/λ m m steady-state transient current current where I =V /Z ;φ=tan −1 (X /R) ;λ=L/R second m m L R=10Ω;X =314×0.1=31.4Ω;Z=10+ j31.4=33∠72.3º L I =400/33=12.1A; φ = 72.3º= 1.26 rad. m sinφ=sin72.3º=0.9527 ;λ=0.1/10=1/100 second i = 121 {sin (314 t – 1.262) + 0.9527 e100t} Substituting t = 0.02 second, we get i = 12.1 (sin (314 × 0.02 – 1.262) + 0.9527 e–2} = 12.1 (sin 5.02 + 0.9527 e–2) = 12.1 (sin 288º + 0.9527 e–2) = 12.1 (– sin 72º + 0.9527 × 0.1353) = 12.1 (– 0.9511 + 0.1289) = –9.95 A Example 22.6. An alternating voltage v = 400 sin (314 t + Ψ) is suddenly applied across a coil of resistance 0.2 Ω and inductance 6.36 mH. Determine the first peak value of the resultant current when the transient current has maximum value. Solution. Obviously, ω = 314 rad/s X = ωL = 314 × 6.36 × 10–3 = 2 Ω L ∠ Coil impedance Z = 0.2 + j2 ~ 2 84.3º Max. value of steady-state current = 400/2 = 200 A As seen from Art. 22.7, the maximum value of transient current will occur when Ψ=φ±π/2 where φ = 84.3º i.e. the phase angle of the current w.r.t. voltage ∴ Ψ = 84.3º – 90º = – 5.7º ∴ resultant current, i = 400 sin (314 t – 90º) + I e–31.4t 0 Now, at t = 0, i = 0 ∴ 0 = 400 sin (– 90º) + I 0 ∴ I = 400 A 0 Hence, the above equation becomes i = 400 sin (ωt – 90º) + 400 e–31.4t The procedure for determining an exact solution for the first peak of the resultant current is first to differentiate the above expression, next to equate the result to zero and then to solve the resulting expression graphically for t. However, sufficiently accurate result can be obtained by determining the instant at which steady-state current reaches its first positive peak value and thenTransients 825 to add to it the value of the transient current at this instant. The first peak value of steady-state current occurs when (314 t – 90º) = π/2 rad ; i.e. when t = π/314 = 0.01 second At this time, i = 400 e–0.314 = 292 A t ∴ resultant current i at this time = 200 + 292 = 492 A 22.8. Transients in R-C Weeries Circuits (D.C.) When a d.c. voltage V is suddenly applied to an R-C series circuit (Fig. 22.6), the voltage v c across the capacitor rises from zero value to the steady-state value V. If v is the voltage across c capacitor, V the transient voltage, then ct v = V + v ... (i) c ct The charging current is maximum at the beginning but then is reduced to zero so that there is no steady-state current but a transient one. Since the transient current is not associated with any applied voltage, hence iR + v = 0 .... (ii) t ct Now, capacitor voltage v = q /C ct 1 Fig. 22.6 Hence, Eq. (ii) becomes q iR+ t =0 t C di 1 dq di 1 dq 1 or R⋅ t + ⋅ t =0 or t =− t =− i ( dq /dt=i ) dt C dt dt CR dt CR t t t di d ∴ t =− t ; As before i =I e −t/CR =I e −t/λ i CR t 0 0 t where CR = λ = time constant. The reciprocal I/CR is known as damping coefficient. (i) Charging Current Fig. 22.7826 Electrical Technology When t = 0, transient current i = I , so that from Eq. (ii) v = – I R. Moreover, when t = 0, t 0 ct 0 v = 0, hence from Eq. (i), v = – V c ct Combining these results, we get I =V/R 0 ∴ i I e t/ V e t/ t 0 R This is plotted in Fig. 22.7 (a) The transient voltage across the resistor R is given by iR= V e −t/λ ×R t R = Ve −t/λ ... Fig. 19.7 (b) From Eq. (ii) the value of transient voltage across the capacitor is v =−iR a t Hence, Eq. (i) becomes v =V−iR=V−Ve −t/λ c t or v =V(1−e −t/λ ) c ... (iii) The voltage across the capacitor v which is the sum of the transient voltage v and steady- c ct state V has been plotted in Fig. 22.7 (c). The charge across the capacitor is given by q=v =CV(1−e −t/λ )or q=Q(1−e −t/λ ) (∴Q=CV) c (ii) Discharge Current When the capacitor has become fully charged so that charging current has ceased, then the R-C circuit is short-circuited by shifting the switch S from position 1 to position 2 (Fig. 22.6). On doing so, a transient discharge current will start flowing immediately. If time is reckoned from the instant of short-circuit, then when t = 0, i = I , hence from t 0 Eq. (ii) above v = – I , R. Moreover, when t = 0, v ct 0 c = V. However, since there is no steady-state voltage across the capacitor, from Eq. (i), we get v = v . c ct Combining these results, we get I =−V/R 0 ∴ i =− V e −t/λ t R It is plotted in Fig. 22.8 (a). The negative sign shows that discharge current flows in a direction opposite to that in which the charging current flows. Fig. 22.8 That is why the curve has been drawn below the X- axis. It may be noted that the only voltage in the circuit is v which equals −iR. ct t Example 22.7.

With reference to Fig. 22.9, let V = applied voltage v = switching-off voltage of the thyratron = 10 V cl v = switching-on voltage of the thyratron = 150 V c2 Now, v V(1 e t/ ) ∴ v =V(1−e −t/λ ) ...

The voltage across the capacitor increases according to the equation Fig. 22.10 v =V(1−e −t/CR) c It is shown in Fig. 22.10 (b) ∴ v =V(1−e −t 1 /λ ) ... (i) c1 v =V(1−e(−t 1 +T)/λ ) ...

Transients in R-C Series Circuits (A.C.) In this case, the resultant currents can be determined in the same way as for an R-L circuit (Art. 22.7). It is given by Fig. 22.11 i=i +i =I sin(ωt+ψ+φ)+I e −t/λ where I =V / R2+X 2 s t m 0 m m C and v=V sin(ωt+ψ) m The value of I as found from initial known conditions (t = 0, i = 0) is given by I = –I sin (ψ+φ) 0 0 m Hence, the resultant current becomes i=I sin(ωt+ψ+φ) m – I sin(ψ+φ)e −t/λ m As shown in Fig. 22.11, the resultant current at the moment of switch closing is OA and is made up of steady-state current OC and transient current OB. 22.10. Double Energy Transients In an R-L-C circuit, both electromagnetic and electrostatic energies are involved, hence any sudden change in the conditions of the circuit involves the redistribution of these two forms of energy. The transient currents produced due to this redistribution are known as double-energy transients. The transient current produced may be unidirectional or a decaying oscillatory current. In an R-L-C circuit, the transient voltages across the three circuit parameters are i ,R,(Ldi /dt) and q /C. Hence, the equation of the transient voltage is t t i di q iR+L t + t =0 ... (i) t dt C Differentiating the above equation and putting i for dq/dt, we get t t d2i R di 1 t + t + i =0 ... (ii) dt2 L dt LC t This is a linear differential equation of the second order with constant coefficient like 2 (i) given in Art. No. 22.3. Its solution is given byTransients 829 i ke 1 t k e 1 t ... (iii) t 1 2 where k and k are constants whose values are found from the boundary conditions. The values of 1 2 λ and λ are given by 1 2 R R2 1 R R2 1 λ =− − − and 1 2L 4L2 LC 2 2L 4L2 LC Depending on the value of λ and λ , four different conditions of the circuit are 1 2 distinguishable. We will now examine these four conditions in the case of an R-L-C circuit. Case 1. Loss-free Circuit, R = 0 i.e. Undamped 1 1 In this case, λ = − = j−1 LC =−jωand λ =− − =−j−1 LC =−jω 1 LC 2 LC Hence, Eq. (iii) given above becomes i =k ejωt +k e −jωt =k (cosωt+ jsinωt)+k (cosωt− jsinωt) t 1 2 1 2 = (k +k )cosωt+ j(k −k )sinωt 1 2 1 2 or i = Acosωt+Bsinωt ... (iv) t where A=k +k and B= j(k −k ) 1 2 1 2 Eq. (iv) can be still further simplified to i =I sin(ωt+φ) ... (v) t m where I = A2+B2 and φ=tan −1(A/B) m As seen from Eq. (v), the transient current in this case is sinusoidal wave of constant peak value and frequency f =1/2π LC as shown in Fig. 22.12 (a). The values of two constant terms I and φ can be determined from any two known initial circuit conditions which are (i) the initial m current in the inductance and (ii) the initial voltage across the capacitor. R2 1 Case 2. Low-loss Circuit: < i.e. Under-damped 4L2 LC In this case, λ and λ would be conjugate complex numbers because the term under the 1 2 square root sign in each case would be negative. R 1 R2 ∴ j 1 2L LC 4L2 R 1 R2 If a= and ω= − then λ =−a+ jω and λ =−a− jω 2L LC 4L2 1 2 Putting these values in equation (v), we get i =ke(−a+jω)t +k e(−a−jω)t =e −at(kejωt +k e −jωt) t 1 2 1 2 This equation can be reduced, as before, to the form i =I e −atsin(ωt+φ) ... (iv) t m where I and φ are constants as before. Equation (vi) represents damped transient oscillatory m current as shown in Fig. 22.12 (b).830 Electrical Technology Fig. 22.12 The exponential term e −at which accounts for the decay of oscillations, is called the decay or damping factor or merely decrement. It makes each current peak a definite fraction less than that preceding it. The logarithm to the Naperian base ‘e’ of the ratio of peaks one cycle apart in time is a/ f =R/2fL and is referred to as logarithmic decrement. The frequency of damped oscillations is given by 1 R2 f = − and is called the natural frequency of the circuit LC 4L2 If R2 < 1 , then f = 1 4L2 LC 2π LC R2 1 Case 3. High-loss Circuit: i.e. overdamped 4L2 LC In this case, λ and λ will be pure numbers. 1 2 R R2 1 λ − + − =−a+γ and γ =−a−γ 1 2L 4L2 LC 2 ∴ i =ke(−a+γ)t +k e(−a−γ)t =e −at(k e γt +k e −γt) t 1 2 1 2 Now ert =sinhγt+coshγt and e −γt =coshγt−sinhγt ∴ i =e −at{(k +k )coshγt+(k −k )sinhγt} t 1 2 1 2 or i =e −at(Acoshγt+Bsinhγt) t A typical curve of this equation is shown in Fig. 22.12(c)Transients 831 R2 1 = Case 4. i.e. Critical Damping 4L2 LC R λ =λ =− In this case, 1 2 2L Hence, equation (iii) is reduced to R i t =(k 1 +k 2 t)e − 2L t or i t =(k 1 +k 2 t)e −at It is a case of critical damping because current is reduced to almost zero in the shortest possible time. The above equation has been plotted in Fig. 22.12 (d). Hence, we can summarize as follows: 1. Transient current is an undamped sine wave if R = 0 2. Transient current is non-oscillatory if R<2 L/C 3. Transient current is non-oscillatory if R≥2 L/C 4. Critical damping occurs if R=2 L/C Example 22.9. A 5-μF capacitor is discharged suddenly through a coil having an inductance of 2H and a resistance of 200 Ω. The capacitor is initially charged to a voltage of 10 V. Find (a) an expression for the current (b) the additional resistance required to give critical damping. Solution. Since there is no battery or generator in the circuit (Fig. 22.13), the steady-state current must be zero. It means that resultant current is simply the transient current. Fig. 22.13 Value of2 L/C =2 2/5×10 −6 = 1265 Ω Since R<2 L/C , the circuit is originally oscillatory. (a) the expression for the transient current, therefore, is i =I e −atsin(ωt+φ) t m where a=R/2L=200/2×2=50 1 R2 100,000 2500 = 312.3 rad/s LC 4L2832 Electrical Technology ∴ i =I e −50tsin(312.3t+φ)=i ... (i) t m Two initial conditions are known from which I and φ can be found (a) at t = 0; i = 0 and m (b) at t = 0; v = 10 V. Applying condition (a) to Eq. (i), we get c 0=I sinφ, hence φ=0 ∴ i=I e −50tsin312.3t ... (ii) m m Now, at t = 0, the voltage across the inductance must be 10 V because the current in the resistance is zero. i.e. (Ldi/dt) = 10 V∴ (di/dt) =10/L = 5 A/s ... (iii) t=0 t=0 Now, from equation (ii), we have di =−50I e −50tsin312.3t+312.3I e −50t cos312.3t ... (iv) dt m m Putting t = 0, it becomes (di/dt) =312.3I t=0 m From equation (iii), we have 312.3I =5 ∴I = 5/312.3 = 0.016 A m m Hence, the general expression for the current becomes i = 0.016 e–50t sin 312.3t It is roughly plotted (the first few cycles only) in Fig. 22.13 (b). (b) Critical damping is achieved when R = 2 L/C ∴ R=2 2/5×10 −6 =1265Ω ∴ Additional resistance reqd. = 1265 – 200 = 1065 Ω Example 22.10. A damped oscillation has the equation i=50e −10t sin 628t. Find the number of oscillations which occurs before the amplitude of the oscillations decays to 1/10th of its undamped value. Solution. Undamped amplitude = 50 A 1/10th amplitude = (1/10) × 50 = 5A Let the time required for this decay be t. Now, the decay of the peak of the oscillations is given by the term 50e −10t ∴ 5=50e −10t ∴ e10t 1 = 10 or 10t =logh10 =2.3log10 =2.3 1 1 1 10 ∴ t = 0.23 second 1 Frequency of oscillations = 628/2π = 100 Hz. Hence, the number of oscillations which occur before the amplitude falls to 1/10th of its undamped value is = 0.23 × 100 = 23 Example 22.11. If, in Fig. 22.14, a break occurs at a point marked X, what would be the voltage across the break? It may be assumed that prior to the break, steady conditions existed in the circuit. Solution. Steady-state current through the inductance = 120/60 = 2A Energy stored in the inductor prior to the break = 1 LI2 = 1 ×12×10 −3×4=24×10 −3J 2 2 Energy initially stored in the capacitor = 1 CV2 = 1 ×10 −8×1202 =72×10 −6 J = 0-practically Fig. 22.14 2 2Transients 833 When the break occurs, the energy stored in the inductor is transferred to the capacitor. If loss of energy during first transfer is neglected, then maximum energy stored in the capacitor is = 20 × 10–3 J ∴ 1 CV2 =24×10 −3 m 2 ∴ V = 2×24×10 −3×108 = 2,190 V m Maximum voltage across the break is = 2190 + 120 = 2310 V The voltage would be oscillatory because the energy alternates between the inductor and capacitor.

According to Fortescue’s theorem, any unbalanced 3-phase system of vectors (whether representing voltages or currents) can be resolved into three balanced systems of vectors which are called its ‘symmetrical components’. In Fig. 23.1 (a) is shown a set of three unbalanced voltage vectors V , V and V having phase A B C sequence A→B→C. These can be regarded as made up of the following symmetrical components :- (i) A balanced system of 3-phase vectors V , V and V having the phase sequence A1 B1 C1 A→B→C as the original set of three unbalanced vectors. These vectors constitute the positive- sequence components [Fig. 23.1 (b)]. (ii) A balanced system of 3-phase vectors V , V and V A2 B2 C2 having phase sequence A→C→B which is opposite to that of the original unbalanced vectors. These vectors constitute the negative- sequence components [Fig. 23.1 (c)]. (iii) A system of three vectors V , V and V which are equal A0 B0 C0 in magnitude and are in phase with each other i.e. V = V = V . A0 B0 C0 These three co-phasal vectors form a uniphase system and are known as zero-sequence components [Fig. 23.1(d).] Hence, it means that an unbalanced 3-phase system of voltages or current can be regarded as due to the superposition of two symmetrical 3-phase systems having opposite phase sequences and a system of zero phase sequence i.e. ordinary single-phase current or voltage system. In Fig. 23.2, each of the original vectors has been 3-phase monitor continuously monitors 3-phase wave lines for abnormal conditionsSymmetrical Components 837 reconstructed by the vector addition of its positive-sequence, negative - sequence and zero- sequence components.

The Positive - sequence Components As seen from above, the positive-sequence components have been designated as V , V and A1 B1 V . The subscript 1 is meant to indicate that the vector belongs to the positive-sequence system. C1 The letter refers to the original vector of which the positive-sequence vector is a component part. These positive-sequence vectors are completely determined when the magnitude and phase of any one of these is known. Usually, these vectors are related to each other with the help of the operator a (for details, please refer to Art. 12.11). As seen from Fig. 23. 1 (b). V = V ; V = a2V = V ∠–120°; V = aV ==V ∠120° A1 A1 B1 A1 A1 C1 A1 A1 23.3. The Negative - sequence Components This system has a phase sequence of A→C→B. Since this system is also balanced, it is completely determined when the magnitude and phase of one of the vectors becomes known. The suffix 2 indicates that the vector belongs to the negative-sequence system. Obviously, as seen from Fig. From 23.1 (c). V = V ; V = a V = V = ∠120°; V = a2V = V ∠−120° A2 A2 B2 A2 A2 C2 A2 A2 23.4. The Zero - sequence Components These three vectors are equal in magnitude and phase and hence form what is known as uniphase system. They are designated as V , V and V . Since these are indentical in magnitude A0 B0 C0 ∴ V = V = V A0 B0 C0 23.5. Graphical Composition of Sequence Vectors Fig. 23.2 Shows how the original vector V has been obtained by the addition of V , V and A A1 A2 V . The same applies to other vectors V and V . A0 B C For simplicity, let us write V as V , V as V and V as V . Then AI 1 A2 2 A0 0 V = V + V + V ... (iv) A 1 2 0 V = a2V + aV + V ... (v) B 1 2 0 V = aV + a2V + V ... (vi) C 1 2 0 23.6. Evaluation of V or V A1 1 The procedure for evaluating V is as follows : 1 Multiplying (v) by a and (vi) by a2, we get aV = a3V + a2V + aV ; a2V = a3V + a4V + a2V B 1 2 0 C 1 2 0 Now a3 = 1and a4 = a, hence838 Electrical Technology aV = V + a2V + aV ... (vii) B 1 2 0 a2V = V + aV + a2V .... (viii) C 1 2 0 Adding (iv), (vii) and (viii), we get V + aV + a2V = 3V + V (1 + a + a2) + V (1 + a + a2) = 3V A B C 1 2 0 1 1 1 ∴ V = (V +aV +a2V )= (V +V ∠120°+V ∠−210°) 1 3 A B C 3 A B C 1 1 3 1 3 3 V A V B 2 j 2 V C 2 j 2 This shows that, geometrically speaking, V is a vector one-third as large as the vector 1 obtained by the vector addition of the three original vectors V , V ∠120° and V ∠–120°. A B C 23.7. Evaluation of V or V A2 2 Multiplying (vi) by a and (v) by a2 and adding them to (iv) we get aV = a2V + a3V + aV ;a2V = a4V + a3V + a2V C 1 2 0 B 1 2 0 V + a2V + aV = V (1 + a + a2) + 3V + V (1 + a + a2) = 3V Now , 1 + a + a2 = 0 A B C 1 2 0 2 1 1 ∴ V = (V +a2V +aV )= (V +V ∠−120°+V ∠120°) 2 3 A B C 3 A B C ⎡ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞⎤ 1 1 3 1 3 = 3 ⎢ ⎢⎣ V A +V B ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ − 2 − j 2 ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ +V C ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ − 2 + j 2 ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎥ ⎥⎦ 23.8. Evaluation of V or V A0 0 Adding (iv), (v) and (vi), we get V +V +V =V(1+a+a2)+V (1+a+a2)+3V =3V A B C 1 2 0 0 1 ∴ V = (V +V +V ) 0 3 A B C It shows that V is simply a vector one third as large as the vector obtained by adding the 0 original vectors V , V and V . A B C To summarize the above results, we have 1 1 (i) V = (V +aV +a2V ) (ii) V (V a2V aV ) 1 3 A B C 2 3 A B C 1 (iii) V = (V +V +V ) 0 3 A B C Note. An unbalanced system of 3-phase currents can also be likewise resolved into its symmetrical components. Hence I =I +I +I ;I =a2I +aI +I ;I =aI +a2I +I A 1 2 0 B 1 2 0 C 1 2 0 1 1 1 Also, as before I = (I +aI +a2I );I = (I +a2I +aI );I = (I +I +I ) ... (ix) 1 3 A B C 2 3 A B C 0 3 A B C It shows that I is one-third of the neutral or earth-return current and is zero for an unearthed 0 3-wire system. It is seen from (ix) above that I is zero if the vector sum of the original current 0 vectors is zero. This fact can be used with advantage in making numerical calculations because the original system of vectors can then be reduced to two balanced 3-phase systems having opposite phase sequences.Symmetrical Components 839 Example 23.1.

A 3-phase, 4-wire system supplies loads which are unequally distributed on the three phases.

Assuming that the 3-phase supply voltages are symmetrical and that the power factor of the load on the R-phase is 3/2 leading, determine the power factor of the loads on the two other phases.

Zero-Sequence Components of Current and Voltage Any circuit which allows the flow of positive-sequence currents will also allow the flow of negative-sequence currents because the two are similar. However, a fourth wire is necessary if zero-sequence components are to flow in the lines of the 3-phase system. It follows that the line currents of 3-phase 3-wire system can contain no zero sequence components whether it is delta - or star-connected. The zero sequence components of line-to-line voltages are non-existent regardless of the degree of imbalance in these voltages. It means that a set of unbalanced 3-phase, line-to-line voltages may be represented by a positive system and a negative system of balanced voltages. This fact is of considerable importance in the analysis of 3-phase rotating machinery. For example, the operation of an induction motor when supplied from an unbalanced system of 3-phase voltages, may be analysed on the basis of two balanced systems of voltages of opposite phase sequence. Let us consider some typical 3-phase connections with reference to zero-sequence components of current and voltage. (a) Four-wire Star Connection. Due to the presence of the fourth wire, the zero sequence currents may flow. The neutral wire carries only the zero-sequence current which is the sum of the zero-sequence currents in the three lines. Since the sum of line voltages is zero, there can be no zero sequence component of line voltages. (b) Three-wire Star Connection. Since there is no fourth or return wire, zero-sequence components of current cannot flow. The absence of zero-sequence currents may be explained by considering that the impedance offered to these currents is infinite and that this impedance is situated between the star points of the generator and the load. If the two star points were joined by a neutral, only zero-sequence currents will flow through it so that only zero-sequence voltage can exist between the load and generator star points. Obviously, no zero-sequence component of voltage appears across the phase load. (c) Three-wire Delta Connection. Due to the absence of fourth wire, zero-sequence components of currents cannot be fed into the delta-connected load. However, though line currents844 Electrical Technology have to sum up to zero (whereas phase currents need not do so) it is possible to have a zero- sequence current circulating in the delta-connected load. Similarly, individual phase voltages will generally possess zero-sequence components though components are absent in the line-to line voltage.* 23.10. Unbalanced Star Load Supplied from Unbalanced Three-phase Three- wire System In this case, line voltages and load currents will consist of only positive and negative- sequence components (but no zero-sequence component). But load voltages will consist of positive, negative and zero-sequence components.

Explain the terms: positive-, negative- and zero-sequence components of a 3-phase voltage system. A star-connected load consists of three equal resistors, each of 1 Ω resistance. When the load is connected to an unsymmetrical 3-phase supply, the line voltages are 200 V, 346 V and 400 V. Find the magnitude of the current in any one phase by the method of symmetrical components. (Power Systems-II, A.M.I.E.) Solution. This question could be solved by using the following two methods: (a) As shown in Fig. 23.6(a), the line voltages form a closed right-angled triangle with an angle = tan −1(346/200)=tan −1(1.732)=60° Hence, if V = 200 ∠0°, then V = 346 ∠– 90° = – j346 and V = 400 ∠120°.

Measurement of Symmetrical Components of Circuits The apparatus consists of two identical current transformers, two impedances of the same ohmic value, one being more inductive than the other to the extent that its phase angle is 60° greater and two identical ammeters A greater and two identical ammeters A and A as shown in 1 1 2 Fig. 23.8 (a). It can be shown that A reads positive-sequence current only while A reads negative- 1 2 sequence current only. If the turn ratio of the current transformer is K, then keeping in mind that zero-sequence component is zero, we have Fig. 23.8 I =I /K =(I +I )/K a R 1 2 where I and I are the positive and negative-sequence 1 2 components of the line current respectively. Similarly, I =I /K =(a2I +aI )/K b Y 1 2 If the impedance of each ammeter is R + jK , then A A impedance between points B and D is Z (R R jX ) BD A A The value of Z is so chosen that Current transformers Z Z R jX (R R jX ) 60 Z 60 AC A A A A BD For finding the current read by A , imagine a break at point X.

However, when the 0 fourth wire is available, then I may be found directly by finding the neutral current I . In that case 0 N 1 I I . 0 3 N 23.13. Measurement of Positive and Negative-sequence *Voltages With reference to Fig. 23.9 (a), it can be shown that the three voltmeters indicate only the positive-sequence component of the 3-phase system. Fig. 23.9 * It is supposed to possess infinite impedance.Symmetrical Components 853 The line-to-neutral voltage can be written (with reference to the red phase) as V =V +V +V ;V =a2V +aV +V ;V =aV +a2V +V RN 1 2 0 YN 1 2 0 BN 1 2 0 V =V +V =V −V =(1−a2)V +(1−a)V RY RN NY RN YN 1 2 V =V +V =V −V =(a2−a)V +(a−a2)V YB YN NB YN BN 1 2 ∴ V V RY (r 1/ j C) V V YB .R DY (R r 1/ j C) YE (R r 1/ j C) (r 1/ j C) R ∴ V V V DE (R r 1/ j C) RY (r 1/ j C) YB The different equation of the bridge circuit are so chosen that R 1 3 r 3 1 3r =−a2 = + j or R= + + + j r+ j1/ωC 2 2 2 2ωC j2ωC 2 Equating the j-terms or quadrature terms on both sides, we have 1 3 1 0= + j ∴ = 3r ...

So do the other two voltmeters. In Fig. 23.9 (b), the elements have been reversed. It can be shown that provided the same relation is maintained between the elements, the high impedance voltmeter measures 3 times the negative-sequence component of phase voltage. 23.14.

Preference for Electricity Energy is vital for all living-beings on earth. Modern life-style has further increased its importance, since a faster life means faster transport, faster communication, and faster manufacturing processes. All these lead to an increase in energy required for all those modern systems. Arising out of comparison of status of nations, the progress is related in terms of per capita consumption of electrical energy (i.e. kWH consumed per person per year). At present, this parameter for India is about 300, for UK it is 12 to 15 times more, and for USA, it is about 30 times more. It simply means that Electrical energy is the most popular form of energy, whether we require it in the usable thermal form (= heating applications), in mechanical form (= electrical motor- applications in Industries), for lighting purposes (= illumination systems), or for transportation systems. Following are the main reasons for its popularity. 1. Cleaner environments for user 2. Higher efficiency 3. Better controllability 4. Easier bulk-power, long-distance transportation of power using overhead transmission or underground cables 5. Most versatile devices of energy conversions from Electrical to other forms are available for different purposes, such as thermal, illumination, mechanical, sound, chemical, etc. 24.2. Comparison of Sources of Power While selecting a method of generating electricity, following factors are taken into account for purposes of comparison: (a) Initial cost: For a given rating of a unit (in the minds of planners), investment must be known. Naturally, lower the initial cost, better it is. (b) Running Cost:- To produce a given amount of electrical energy, the cost of conversion process (including proportional cost of maintenance/repairs of the system) has to be known. (c) Limitations:- Whether a particular resource is available, whether a unit size of required rating is available from a single unit or from an array of large number of units, and whether a particular method of generation is techno-economically viable and is time-proven, are typical queries related to the limitations of the concerned method. (d) (1) perpetuity, (2) efficiency, (3) reliability, (4) cleanliness and (5) simplicity. It is naturally desirable that the source must have perpetuity (= be of endless duration), high conversion efficiency, and reliability (in terms of availability in appropriate quantity). The energy conversion must be through a cleaner process (specially from the view- points of toxicity, pollution or any other hazardous side effects). Further, a simpler overall system is always preferred with regards to maintenance/repairs problems and is supposed to be more reliable. 24.3. Sources for Generation of Electricity Following types of resources are available for generating electrical energy (No doubt, this list can be extended to include some more up-coming resources. The following list, however, gives the popular and potential resources). (a) Conventional methods (a) Thermal: Thermal energy (from fossil fuels) or Nuclear Energy used for producing steam for turbines which drive the alternators (= rotating a.c. generators). (b) Hydro-electric: Potential of water stored at higher altitudes is utilized as it is passed through water-turbines which drive the alternators. (b) Non-conventional methods (c) Wind power: High velocities of wind (in some areas) are utilized in driving wind turbines coupled to alternators. Wind power has a main advantage of having zero production cost. The cost of the equipment and the limit of generating-unit-rating is suitable for a particularIntroduction to Electrical Energy Generation 857 location (= geographically) are the important constraints. This method has exclusive advantages of being pollution free and renewable. It is available in plentiful quantity, at certain places. It suffers from the disadvantages of its availability being uncertain (since dependent on nature) and the control being complex (since wind-velocity has wide range of variation, as an input, and the output required is at constant voltage and constant frequency). Single large-power units cannot be planned due to techno-economic considerations. (d) Fuel cells: These are devices which enable direct Use of Wind Powder conversion of energy, chemically, into electrical form. This is an up-coming technology and has a special merit of being pollution-free and noise-free. It is yet to become popular for bulk-power generation. (e) Photo voltaic cells: These directly convert solar energy into electrical energy through a chemical action taking place in solar cells. These operate based on the photo-voltaic effect, which develops an emf on absorption of ionizing radiation from Sun. Power Scenario In India:- Following approximate statistical data give an idea about some aspects in this regard. Total installed capacity : 150,000 MW Hydropower : 50,000 MW Nuclear : 10,000 MW Thermal (fossil fuels) : 80,000 MW Other methods : 10,000 MW Other methods include partly exploited Potential such as Wind, Solar, Co-generation, Methods using Bio-fuels, etc. 24.4. Brief Aspects of Electrical Energy Systems 24.4.1. Utility and Consumers At generating stations, power is generated at the best locations. Load-centres are generally away from these. Generation-units and Loads are connected by transmission systems. Thus, the energy system is divided into two main parts. (a) Utility (including sources and transmission network) and, (b) Consumers (who utilize the electrical energy) 24.4.2. Why is the three- phase a. c. system most popular? (a) It is well known that a.c. generation is simpler (than d.c. generation through electrical machines because of absence of commutators in a.c. machines). Further, mechanical commutation system in d.c. machines sets an upper limit of their size, while the rating of the individual generators in modern power stations is too large, say about 1500 times the rating of a single largest feasible d.c. machine. A.C. further facilitates in stepping down or stepping-up of a voltage to suit a particular requirement, with the help of a simple device, the well-known transformer. (b) Changing over from a.c. to d.c. is very easy these days due to the rectifiers of sufficiently high power ratings, so that a wide range of d.c. – applications can now be catered to. (c) As the number of phases goes on increasing the power-output (from a device using a given quantity of active material, namely, that used for core and for winding) increases, but the number of circuits (i.e. connecting lines/ wires, switches, etc) also increases. These two points are contradictory. A choice will be in favour of such a number (of phases) which will be high enough from power-output point of view but low enough from viewpoints858 Electrical Technology of complexity of connecting/controlling large number of phases. There is a Golden compromise. It has resulted into popularity of the three-phase a. c. systems over the entire time period. Now it has almost become a standard practice for all purposes. 24.4.3. Cost of Generation Cost of generation for one unit of electrical energy depends on the method of generation, formulae worked to assess its running cost under the specified conditions, and the cost of transmission line loss to transport power upto the load. These days, a modern utility (= electricity board) has a large number of generators sharing the responsibility of supplying power to all the customers connected to the Grid (= common supply-network). Then, for an increase in load-demand, at a known location, the most economical generating unit is to be identified and that unit should be monitored to meet the increased demand. 24.4.4. Staggering of Loads during Peak-demand Hours Incentives to consumers (by way of supplying at reduced rates during light load hours e.g. Late night ‘hours, after noon hours) help in even demand throughout the day. 24.4.5. Classifications of Power Transmission (a) Using underground cables or using overhead transmission lines. (b) Extra High Voltage A.C.-versus-Extra High Voltage D.C. transmission systems. 24.4.6. Selecting A.C. Transmission Voltage for a Particular Case In general, for transporting a given power of V I watts, either V can be high or V can be low. Accordingly, the current can be either low or high respectively. Higher voltage means higher cost of insulation, and larger clearances. Higher current means larger cross section of conductors. Considering these together, the most economical voltage has to be found out for a particular requirement. Kelvin’s Laws give a guideline for this. (These are discussed in Art. 47.21 in Vol. III, of this book). 24.5. Conventional Sources of Electrical Energy Thermal (coal, gas, nuclear) and hydro-generations are the main conventional methods of generation of Electrical Energy. These enjoy the advantages of reaching perfections in technologies for these processes. Further, single units rated at large power-outputs can be manufactured along with main components, auxiliaries and switch- gear due to vast experiences during the past century. These are efficient and economical. These suffer from the disadvantages listed below: 1. The fuels are likely to be depleted in near future, forcing us to conserve them and find alternative resources. 2. Toxic, hazardous fumes and residues pollute the environment. 3. Overall conversion efficiency is poor. 4. Generally, these are located at remote places with respect to main load centres, increasing the transmission costs and reducing the system efficiency. 5. Maintenance costs are high. Out of these, only two such types will be dealt here, which have a steam turbine working as the prime mover. While remaining two use Internal Combustion Engines (I.C. engines) or Gas turbine as the prime mover, and these will not be dealt with, in this Introductory treatment. The steam-turbine driven systems are briefly discussed below. 24.5.1. Steam Power Stations (Coal-fired) India has rich stocks of coal as a natural resource. Chemical energy stored within the coal is finally transformed into Electrical energy through the process of these stations. Heat released by the combustion of coal produces steam in a boiler at elevated temperatures and pressures. It is then passed through steam turbines, which drive the alternator, the output of which is the electrical energy.Introduction to Electrical Energy Generation 859 Figure 24.1 shows a simple schematic diagram of a modern coal-fired thermal station. In India, coal is generally of low grade containing ash upto 40 %. It poses two problems. (i) Calorific value is low and hence system efficiency can be increased only by additional processes like pulverizing the coal and using oil firing to start with, (ii) large volumes of ash have to be handled after ensuring that ash is extracted to the maximum possible extent (upto 99 %) by using electrostatic precipitators, before flue gases from boiler are finally passed on to the atmosphere. Coal is burnt in the boiler. This heat converts water into steam when passed through the boiler tubes. Modern plants have super heaters to raise the temperature and pressure of steam so that plant efficiency is increased. Condenser and cooling tower deal with steam coming out of turbine. Here, maximum heat is extracted from steam (which then takes the form of water) to pre-heat the incoming water and also to recycle the water for its best utilization. Steam-turbine receives controlled steam from boiler and converts its energy into mechanical energy which drives the 3-ph a. c. generator (=alternator). The alternator delivers electrical energy, at its rated voltage (which may be between 11 to 30 kV). Through a circuit breaker, the step up transformer is supplied.

Schematic Diagram of a Coal-fired Thermal Station of this transformer may be 220 or 400 kV (as per figures for India). Through Extra-High Voltage Switch gear, the Bus is energized and the EHV primary transmission line can transport power to the Load centres connected to it. A modern coal-fired thermal power station consumes about 10 % of its power for supplying to the Auxiliaries. These are mainly as follows. (a) Main-exciter for alternator. (b) Water pumps. (c) Fans: Forced draught and Induced draught fans for Pre-heaters and Chimney. (d) Coal handling plant including pulverising mill. (e) Ash handling plant including Electrolytic Precipitator. Naturally, whenever such a station is to be brought into operation (either at commissioning or after repairs/maintenance schedule) the power required for the auxiliaries has to be supplied by the grid. Once the system is energized fully, it will look after supplying power to its own auxiliaries. Merits of Coal-fired thermal stations 1. Fuel (=coal) is cheap. 2. Less initial cost is required. 3. It requires less space. 4. As a combination of all above points, the cost of generating unit of electrical energy is less.860 Electrical Technology Demerits 1. Atmospheric pollution is considerable. 2. Coal may have to be transported over long distances, in some cases, after some years, and then the energy cost may be quite high. 24.5.2. Nuclear Power Stations Nuclear energy is available as a result of fission reaction. In a typical system, Uranium 235 is bombarded with neutrons and Heat energy is released. In chain-reaction, these release more neutrons, since more Uranium 235 atoms are fissioned. Speeds of Neutrons must be reduced to critical speeds for the chain reaction to take place. Moderators (= speed-reducing agents like graphite, heavy water, etc). are used for this purpose. Nuclear fuel rods (of Uranium 235) must be embedded in speed- reducing agents. Further, control rods (made of cadmium) are required since they are strong neutron- absorbers and help in finely regulating this reaction so that power control of the generator is precisely obtainable. When control rods are pulled out and are away from fuel rods, intensity of chain reaction increases, which increases the power output of the system. While if they are pushed in and closer to the fuel rods, the power-output decreases. Thus, the electrical load demand on the generator decides (automatically) the control-rod positions through a very sophisticated control system. Fig. 24.2 shows a basic scheme of such a Nuclear power-station. Advantages of Nuclear Generation 1. Quantity of fuel required is small for generating a given amount of electrical energy, compared to that with other fuels. 2. It is more reliable, cheaper for running cost, and is efficient when operated at rated capacity. Disadvantages 1. Fuel is expensive and not abundantly available everywhere. 2. It has high capital cost. 3. Maintenance charges are high. 4. Nuclear waste disposal is a problem.

Schematic Diagram of a Nuclear Power Station indicating Main Components 24.5.3. Hydroelectric Generation Water-reservoir at higher altitudes is a pre-requisite for this purpose. Power-house is located at a lower level. The difference in these two levels is known as “Head.” Based on the “Heads”, the Hydroelectric stations are categorized below: 1. Low head up to 60 metres. 2. Medium head between 60 and 300 metres. 3. High heads above 300 metres.Introduction to Electrical Energy Generation 861 In this method of generation, water from higher height is passed through penstock as controlled in the valve-house, into the water turbine. Thus, potential energy of water stored at higher altitudes is first converted into Kinetic energy. As the water reaches the turbine, it gains speed after losing the Potential energy. Kinetic energy of this speedy water drives the water turbine, which converts this into mechanical output. It drives the coupled generator, which gives Electrical energy output. A schematic diagram of such a system is shown in fig. The valve house has a controlling valve (=main sluice valve) and a protecting valve (= an automatic, isolating, “butterfly” type valve). As is obvious, power control is done by the main sluice valve, while “butterfly” valve comes into action if water flows in opposite direction as a result of a sudden drop in load on the generator. Otherwise, the penstock is subjected to extreme strains and it has a tendency to burst due to pressure of water as a result of sudden load reduction.

Schematic of a typical Hydroelectric station Note: Variation of Head (low-, medium-, or high-head) will affect the block-schematic After doing the work (of imparting its energy to the water turbine), the water is allowed to pass into the tail-race reservoir. The water turbines are essentially low-speed prime movers. In that, the best operating speed is dependent on the head. Alternators coupled to water turbines thus have large number of poles (since P= 120 f/N). Such alternators have the Salient-Pole type rotor. There are different types of water turbines suitable for different cases (i.e. Heads, Power rating, Load-variation curve, etc). Since, this is only an elementary treatment, these aspects will not be discussed here. 24.6. Non-Conventional Energy Sources Considering the previously discussed thermal methods of conventional energy-generations, it is necessary to understand the non-conventional energy sources, since they have two points in their favour. (a) Non-polluting processes are used. (b) Perpetuity and renewability of the main source (which is a natural atmospheric resource) generally exists. The non-conventional energy sources are further advantageous due to virtually zero running cost, since wind energy or solar energy is the input-source of power. However, they are disadvantageous due to high initial cost (per MW of installed capacity) and due to uncertainty resulting out of weather changes. For example, dense clouds (or night hours) lead to non-availability of solar energy. Similarly, “still-air” condition means no possibility of wind power generation, and during stormy weathers, wind turbines cannot be kept in operation (due to dangerously high speeds they would attain if kept in operation). 24.6.1. Photo Voltaic Cells (P.V. Cells or SOLAR Cells) When ionized solar radiation is incident on a semi-conductor diode, energy conversion can take place with a voltage of 0.5 to 1 volt (d.c.) and a current density of 20-40 mA/cm2, depending on the862 Electrical Technology materials used and the conditions of Sunlight. Area of these solar cells decides Solar the current output. An array of large number of such diodes (i.e. Solar cells) results into higher d.c. output voltage. Since, the final form of electrical energy required is generally an alternating P-type material + - - + current, it is realized from d.c. using + - - + ve inverters. + At quite a few locations in India, N- type Output for realizing few hundred kilowatts of power-rating, huge arrays are accommodated in horizontal as well as - ve vertical stacks, so that land area required Fig. 24.4. Photo Voltaic (or Solar Cell ) is not too vast. Electrically, they are connected in series and in parallel combinations of cells so that rated voltage and current are realized. Just to understand the principle of operation of solar cells, let a semi-conductor diode receive ionized radiation from Sun, as in fig. 24.4. Typical materials used for these cells are: material doped with boron, cadmium sulphide, gallium- arsenide, etc. Their choice is mainly decided by conversion efficiency. Best material may lead to the efficiency being typically 15%. Since solar energy is available free of cost, this low-efficiency does not matter. This method suffers from the disadvantages of having high initial cost and uncertainty (since dependent on weather conditions) including non operative night periods. Main advantages are: (i) no running cost (however, replacements of components may be a botheration), (ii) no pollution, (iii) location can be near the load (hence transportation of power is not required over long distances). (iv) since natural source is involved, it is perpetual. Individual stations using solar cells are in operation with ratings of the order of 250-1000 kW. With manufacturing costs of semi-conductor devices going down and with the advent of better and better quality of cells which will be available in future, this method of generation has bright prospects. 24.6.2. Fuel Cells 24.6.2.1. Principle of Operation In Fuel cells, negative porous electrode is fed by hydrogen and the positive porous electrode is fed by oxygen. Both the electrodes are immersed in an electrolyte. The porous electrodes are made of such a conducting material that both the fuel (oxygen and hydrogen) and the electrolyte can pass through them. Such a material for electrodes is nickel. The electrolyte is a solution of sulphuric acid or potassium hydroxide. The electrodes have a catalyst (= platinum or sintered nickel) which break the fuel compound into more reactive atoms. 24.6.2.2. Chemical Process (with Acidic Electrolyte) At Negative Electrode : 2H —→ 4H+ + 4e 2 These hydrogen ions enter the solution (=electrolyte) leaving behind electrons which pass through external circuit to the positive electrode. At Positive Electrode: O + 4H+ + 4 → 2HO 2 2 Thus, the combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen results into water at the positive electrode. Water is the waste-product of the cell, which is harmless. The process is, thus, pollution free. There is no source of energy required, since the process is basically “chemical” in nature.Introduction to Electrical Energy Generation 863 24.6.2.3.

Fuel Cell 24.6.2.4. Array for Large outputs A fuel cell has a d. c. output voltage typically of 1.23 volts at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature. Raising pressure and temperature increases this voltage. To realize large output parameters (= voltage, current, and hence power), an array of a large number of fuel cells (connected in series as well as in parallel) is made. Voltage levels of 100 to 1000 V and power levels in kilowatts can be realized. 24.6.2.5. High Lights 1. Pollution-free, noiseless. 2. No outside source of energy is required. 3. Efficient. 4. No restriction on location (a) High initial cost. (b) Working life is short. Note: Solar energy can also be used for generating electrical energy through an intermediate stage of producing steam, which is used later for driving an alternator. However, this method is not discussed here. 24.6.3. Wind Power 24.6.3.1. Background Wind power has been in use for serving the mankind, since centuries through what has been popularly known as “Wind-mills.” There is no “electrical” stage of energy in old-styled uses where wind-velocity is directly used for performing the jobs such as wheat-grinding, pumping water for irrigation, sailing vessels, etc. It enjoys the advantages of being plentiful, inexhaustible, renewable and non-polluting, over and above being cheap for running costs. It suffers from disadvantages of being unreliable, and being economically un-viable for large power generation. In India, a large number of such units with small and medium power ratings (up to 100 kW) are already in operation mainly in coastal or hilly areas. With the modern system, it is now preferred to have suitable power- control circuits on the output side of wind-generators so that these can pump energy into low voltage lines of the grid over a wide range of variation of wind speeds. 24.6.3.2. Basic Scheme A large variety of wind-turbines naturally exist arising out of large variation in wind-pattern864 Electrical Technology Fig. 24.6 (a) . Wind-generation, Fig. 24.6 (b). Part-side-view to show a typical a Schematic view three bladed wind turbine all over and out of different manufacturers producing systems with different designs. Since the aim here is to understand the basic system, only one type of system is presented here. In Fig. 24.6 (a) an arrangement wherein, a horizontal three-bladed system is shown mounted on a tower. Through rotation- transformation using gears to step up the speed and to link the horizontal axis of turbine with vertical axis of generator. The speed of wind varies, as Fig. 24.7 such turbine speed also varies so that output frequency and voltage of three-phase alternator vary over a wide range. Further, its waveform is also a distorted one. To increase its utility, it is necessary to modulate (through proper power-control) to derive line-frequency constant voltage output and hook-up to local grid for pumping the available wind-energy into it. This is schematically represented in fig 24.7. 24.6.3.3. Indian Scenario Wind farms have been located where a large number of wind generators of ratings of few hundred kilowatts are in operation. For every unit, there is a safe wind - speed zone. If the wind-speed is below this, there is no appreciable power output, hence, it is better that the system is not brought into operation. If the wind speeds are too high, it is mechanically unsafe and hence it is not to be operated, even if the energy available is higher. This is decided by automated system. Such forms are located in coastal regions and in hilly areas. Because of the metering of energy received by the local grid, the investor can get a good return through payment from the grid-authorities. Hence, this has become a medium-level and attractive industrial investment.
