uthors feel happy to present to their esteemed readers this
revised first multicoloured edition of Vol. I of “A Textbook of
Electrical Technology”. To provide a comprehensive treatment
of topics in ‘‘Basic Electrical Engineering’’ both for electrical as well
as non-electrical students pursuing their studies in civil, mechanical,
mining, textile, chemical, industrial, environmental, aerospace, electronic
and computer engineering, information technology both at the Degree
and Diploma level. Based on the suggestions received from our
esteemed readers, both from India and abroad, the scope of the book
has been enlarged according to their requirements.
Establishment of Technological Universities have taken place in
recent past. This resulted into a pool of expert manpower within a
large area. Unification of syllabi has taken place and the question
papers set during the last 4-5 years have a wider variety and are of
more inquisitive nature. Solutions to these with brief logical reasonings
have been added for the benefit of our student community.
Many universities include a brief coverage on methods of “Electrical
Power Generation”, in their first and basic paper on this subject.
Hence, this revision includes an introductory chapter on this topic.
It is earnestly hoped that with these extensive additions and
revisions, this revised edition will prove even more useful to our
numerous readers in developing more confidence while appearing at
national competitive examinations.
I would like to thank my Publishers particularly Mr. Ravindra
Kumar Gupta, M.D. and Mr. Bhagirath Kaushik, Regional Manager
(Western India) of S. Chand & Company Ltd., for the personal interest
they look in the publishing of this revised and enlarged edition.
Our student-friends, teacher-colleagues, Booksellers and University
authorities have been showing immense faith and affection in our
book, which is acknowledged with modesty and regards. We are sure
that this revised edition will satisfy their needs to a still greater extent
and serve its cause more effectively.

addition of Millman’s Theorem (as applicable to voltage and current
sources or both) and an article on Power Transfer Efficiency relating
to Maximum Power Transfer Theorem.
3. The additions to the chapter on Capacitors include detailed
articles on Transient Relations during Capacitor Charging and Discharging
Cycles and also the Charging and Discharging of a Capacitor with
Initial Charge.
4. Chapter on Chemical Effects of Current has been thoroughly
revised with the inclusion of Electronic Battery Chargers, Static
Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Systems, High Temperature
Batteries, Secondary Hybrid Cells, Fuel Cells and Aircraft and Submarine
Batteries.

1.1. Electron Drift Velocity
Suppose that in a conductor, the number of free electrons The electron moves at the
Fermi speed, and has only
available per m3 of the conductor material is n and let their a tiny drift velocity superimposed
axial drift velocity be ν metres/second. In time dt, distance by the applied electric field
travelled would be ν × dt. If A is area of cross-section of the
conductor, then the volume is νAdt and the number of elec-
trons contained in this volume is νA dt. Obviously, all these
electrons will cross the conductor cross-section in time dt. If
drift
e is the charge of each electron, then total charge which crosses V d velocity
the section in time dt is dq = nAeν dt.
Electric
Since current is the rate of flow of charge, it is given as Field E
dq nAeνdt
i = = ∴ i = nAeν
dt dt
Current density, J = i/A = ne ν ampere/metre2
Assuming a normal current density J = 1.55 × 106 A/m2, n = 1029 for a copper conductor
and e = 1.6 × 10 −19 coulomb, we get
1.55 × 106 = 1029 × 1.6 × 10 −19 × ν ∴ ν = 9.7 × 10 −5 m/s = 0.58 cm/min
It is seen that contrary to the common but mistaken view, the electron drift velocity is rather very
slow and is independent of the current flowing and the area of the conductor.
→
N.B.Current density i.e., the current per unit area, is a vector quantity. It is denoted by the symbol J .
→
Therefore, in vector notation, the relationship between current I and J is :

I = J.a [where a is the vector notation for area ‘a’]
For extending the scope of the above relationship, so that it becomes applicable for area of any shape, we
write :
I = J.da
The magnitude of the current density can, therefore, be written as J·α.
Example 1.1. A conductor material has a free-electron density of 1024 electrons per metre3.
When a voltage is applied, a constant drift velocity of 1.5 × 10 −2 metre/second is attained by the
electrons. If the cross-sectional area of the material is 1 cm2, calculate the magnitude of the current.
Electronic charge is 1.6 × 10 −19 coulomb. (Electrical Engg. Aligarh Muslim University)
Solution. The magnitude of the current is
i = nAeν amperes
Here, n = 1024 ; A = 1 cm2 = 10 −4 m2
e = 1.6 × 10 −19 C ; v = 1.5 × 10 −2 m/s
∴ i = 1024 × 10 −4 × 1.6 × 10 −19 × 1.5 × 10 −2 = 0.24 A
1.2. Charge Velocity and Velocity of Field Propagation
The speed with which charge drifts in a conductor is called the velocity of charge. As seen from
above, its value is quite low, typically fraction of a metre per second.
However, the speed with which the effect of e.m.f. is experienced at all parts of the conductor
resulting in the flow of current is called the velocity of propagation of electrical field. It is indepen-
dent of current and voltage and has high but constant value of nearly 3 × 108 m/s.Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 3
Example 1.2. Find the velocity of charge leading to 1 A current which flows in a copper
conductor of cross-section 1 cm2 and length 10 km. Free electron density of copper = 8.5 × 1028 per
m3. How long will it take the electric charge to travel from one end of the conductor to the other?
Solution. i = neAν or ν = i/neA
∴ ν = 1/(8.5 × 1028 × 1.6 × 10 −19 × 1 × 10 −4) = 7.35 × 10 −7 m/s = 0.735 μm/s
Time taken by the charge to travel conductor length of 10 km is
t = distance =
10×103
= 1.36 × 1010 s
velocity 7.35×10 −7
Now, 1 year = 365 × 24 × 3600 = 31,536,000 s
t = 1.36 × 1010/31,536,000 = 431 years
1.3. The Idea of Electric Potential
In Fig. 1.1, a simple voltaic cell is shown. It consists of copper plate (known as anode) and a
zinc rod (i.e. cathode) immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (H SO ) contained in a suitable vessel. The
2 4
chemical action taking place within the cell causes the electrons to be removed from copper plate and
to be deposited on the zinc rod at the same time. This transfer of electrons is accomplished through
the agency of the diluted H SO which is known as the electrolyte. The result is that zinc rod becomes
2 4
negative due to the deposition of electrons on it and the copper plate becomes positive due to the
removal of electrons from it. The large number of electrons collected on the zinc rod is being attracted
by anode but is prevented from returning to it by the force set up by the chemical action within the cell.
Fig. 1.1. Fig. 1.2
But if the two electrodes are joined by a wire externally, then electrons rush to the anode thereby
equalizing the charges of the two electrodes. However, due to the continuity of chemical action, a
continuous difference in the number of electrons on the two electrodes is maintained which keeps up
a continuous flow of current through the external circuit. The action of an electric cell is similar to
that of a water pump which, while working, maintains a continuous flow of water i.e., water current
through the pipe (Fig. 1.2).
It should be particularly noted that the direction of electronic current is from zinc to copper in
the external circuit. However, the direction of conventional current (which is given by the direction4 Electrical Technology
of flow of positive charge) is from copper to zinc. In the present case, there is no flow of positive
charge as such from one electrode to another. But we can look upon the arrival of electrons on copper
plate (with subsequent decrease in its positive charge) as equivalent to an actual departure of positive
charge from it.
When zinc is negatively charged, it is said to be at negative potential with respect to the electrolyte,
whereas anode is said to be at positive potential relative to the electrolyte. Between themselves,
copper plate is assumed to be at a higher potential than the zinc rod. The difference in potential is
continuously maintained by the chemical action going on in the cell which supplies energy to establish
this potential difference.
1.4. Resistance
It may be defined as the property of a substance due
to which it opposes (or restricts) the flow of electricity
(i.e., electrons) through it.
Metals (as a class), acids and salts solutions are good
conductors of electricity. Amongst pure metals, silver,
copper and aluminium are very good conductors in the
given order.* This, as discussed earlier, is due to the
presence of a large number of free or loosely-attached
electrons in their atoms. These vagrant electrons assume
a directed motion on the application of an electric potential
difference. These electrons while flowing pass through
the molecules or the atoms of the conductor, collide and
other atoms and electrons, thereby producing heat.
Those substances which offer relatively greater
Cables are often covered with materials that
difficulty or hindrance to the passage of these electrons do not carry electric current easily
are said to be relatively poor conductors of electricity like
bakelite, mica, glass, rubber, p.v.c. (polyvinyl chloride) and dry wood etc. Amongst good insulators
can be included fibrous substances such as paper and cotton when dry, mineral oils free from acids
and water, ceramics like hard porcelain and asbestos and many other plastics besides p.v.c. It is
helpful to remember that electric friction is similar to friction in Mechanics.
1.5. The Unit of Resistance
The practical unit of resistance is ohm.** A conductor is said to
have a resistance of one ohm if it permits one ampere current to flow
through it when one volt is impressed across its terminals.
For insulators whose resistances are very high, a much bigger unit
is used i.e., mega-ohm = 106 ohm (the prefix ‘mega’ or mego meaning
a million) or kilo-ohm = 103 ohm (kilo means thousand). In the case of
very small resistances, smaller units like milli-ohm = 10
−3
ohm or mi-
cro-ohm = 10 −6 ohm are used. The symbol for ohm is Ω.
George Simon Ohm
* However, for the same resistance per unit length, cross-sectional area of aluminium conductor has to be
1.6 times that of the copper conductor but it weighs only half as much. Hence, it is used where economy
of weight is more important than economy of space.
** After George Simon Ohm (1787-1854), a German mathematician who in about 1827 formulated the law
known after his name as Ohm’s Law.Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 5

1.6. Laws of Resistance
The resistance R offered by a conductor depends on the following factors :
(i) It varies directly as its length, l.
(ii) It varies inversely as the cross-section A of the conductor.
(iii) It depends on the nature of the material.
(iv) It also depends on the temperature of the conductor.
Fig. 1.3. Fig. 1.4
Neglecting the last factor for the time being, we can say that
R ∝ l or R = ρ l ...(i)
A A
where ρ is a constant depending on the nature of the material of the conductor and is known as its
specific resistance or resistivity.
If in Eq. (i), we put
l = 1 metre and A = 1 metre2, then R = ρ (Fig. 1.4)
Hence, specific resistance of a material may be defined as the resistance between the opposite
faces of a metre cube of that material.
1.7. Units of Resistivity
From Eq. (i), we have ρ = AR
l6 Electrical Technology
In the S.I. system of units,
ρ =
Ametre2×Rohm
= AR ohm-metre
l metre l
Hence, the unit of resistivity is ohm-metre (Ω-m).
It may, however, be noted that resistivity is sometimes expressed as so many ohm per m3.
Although, it is incorrect to say so but it means the same thing as ohm-metre.
If l is in centimetres and A in cm2, then ρ is in ohm-centimetre (Ω-cm).
Values of resistivity and temperature coefficients for various materials are given in Table 1.2.
The resistivities of commercial materials may differ by several per cent due to impurities etc.

1.8. Conductance and Conductivity
Conductance (G) is reciprocal of resistance*. Whereas resistance of a conductor measures the
opposition which it offers to the flow of current, the conductance measures the inducement which it
offers to its flow.
From Eq. (i) of Art. 1.6, R = ρ A l or G= ρ 1 . A l = σ l A
where σ is called the conductivity or specific conductance of a conductor. The unit of conductance
is siemens (S). Earlier, this unit was called mho.
It is seen from the above equation that the conductivity of a material is given by
σ = G l =
Gsiemens×lmetre
=G l siemens/metre
A Ametre2 A
Hence, the unit of conductivity is siemens/metre (S/m).
1.9. Effect of Temperature on Resistance
The effect of rise in temperature is :
(i) to increase the resistance of pure metals. The increase is large and fairly regular for normal
ranges of temperature. The temperature/resistance graph is a straight line (Fig. 1.6). As
would be presently clarified, metals have a positive temperature co-efficient of resistance.
(ii) to increase the resistance of alloys, though in their case, the increase is relatively small and
irregular. For some high-resistance alloys like Eureka (60% Cu and 40% Ni) and manganin,
the increase in resistance is (or can be made) negligible over a considerable range of
temperature.
(iii) to decrease the resistance of electrolytes, insulators (such as paper, rubber, glass, mica etc.)
and partial conductors such as carbon. Hence, insulators are said to possess a negative
temperature-coefficient of resistance.
1.10.Temperature Coefficient of Resistance
Let a metallic conductor having a resistance of R at 0°C be heated of t°C and let its resistance at
0
this temperature be R. Then, considering normal ranges of temperature, it is found that the increase
t
in resistance Δ R = R − R depends
t 0
(i) directly on its initial resistance
(ii) directly on the rise in temperature
(iii) on the nature of the material of the conductor.
or R − R ∝ R × t or R − R = α R t ...(i)
t 0 t 0 0
where α (alpha) is a constant and is known as the temperature coefficient of resistance of the conduc-
tor.

Rearranging Eq. (i), we get α = R t ×t 0 = R ×t
0 0
If R = 1 Ω, t = 1°C, then α = Δ R = R − R
0 t 0
Hence, the temperature-coefficient of a material may be defined as :
the increase in resistance per ohm original resistance per °C rise in temperature.
From Eq. (i), we find that R = R (1 + α t) ...(ii)
t 0
* In a.c. circuits, it has a slightly different meaning.Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 11
It should be remembered that the
above equation holds good for both rise
as well as fall in temperature. As tem-
perature of a conductor is decreased,
its resistance is also decreased. In Fig.
1.6 is shown the temperature/resistance
graph for copper and is practically a
straight line. If this line is extended
backwards, it would cut the tempera-
ture axis at a point where temperature
is − 234.5°C (a number quite easy to
remember). It means that theoretically,
the resistance of copper conductor will Fig. 1.6
become zero at this point though as
shown by solid line, in practice, the curve departs from a straight line at very low temperatures.
From the two similar triangles of Fig. 1.6 it is seen that :
( )

=
t +234.5 = 1+ t
R 234.5 234.5
0 ( )
∴ R = R 1+ t or R = R (1 + α t) where α = 1/234.5 for copper.
t 0 234.5 t 0
1.11.Value of ααααα at Different Temperatures
So far we did not make any distinction between values of α at different temperatures. But it is
found that value of α itself is not constant but depends on the initial temperature on which the
increment in resistance is based. When the increment is based on the resistance measured at 0°C,
then α has the value of α. At any other initial temperature t°C, value of α is αand so on. It should
0 t
be remembered that, for any conductor, α has the maximum value.
0
Suppose a conductor of resistance R at 0°C (point A in Fig. 1.7) is heated to t°C (point B). Its
0
resistance R after heating is given by

Now, suppose that we have a conductor of resistance R at temperature t°C. Let
t
this conductor be cooled from t°C to 0°C. Obviously, now the initial point is B
and the final point is A. The final resistance R is given in terms of the initial
0
resistance by the following equation
R = R [1 + α (− t)] = R (1 − α . t) ...(ii)
0 t t t t
R −R
From Eq. (ii) above, we have α= t 0

1.12. Variations of Resistivity with Temperature
Not only resistance but specific
resistance or resistivity of metallic
conductors also increases with rise
in temperature and vice-versa.
As seen from Fig. 1.8 the
resistivities of metals vary linearly
with temperature over a significant
range of temperature-the variation
becoming non-linear both at very
high and at very low temperatures.
Let, for any metallic conductor,
ρ = resistivity at t °C
1 1

ρ = resistivity at t °C

m = Slope of the linear part of the curve

or ρ 2 = ρ 1 + m (t 2 − t 1 ) or 2 1 1

(t 2 t 1 )

The ratio of m/ρ is called the temperature coefficient of resistivity at temperature t °C. It may
1 1
be defined as numerically equal to the fractional change in ρ per °C change in the temperature from
1
t °C. It is almost equal to the temperature-coefficient of resistance α. Hence, putting α = m/ρ ,
1 1 1 1
weget
ρ = ρ [1 + α (t − t )] or simply as ρ = ρ (1 + α t)
2 1 1 2 1 t 0 0
Note. It has been found that although temperature is the most significant factor influencing the resistivity
of metals, other factors like pressure and tension also affect resistivity to some extent. For most metals except
lithium and calcium, increase in pressure leads to decrease in resistivity. However, resistivity increases with
increase in tension.

Example 1.14. Two coils connected in series have resistances of 600 Ω and 300 Ω with tempt.
coeff. of 0.1% and 0.4% respectively at 20°C. Find the resistance of the combination at a tempt. of
50°C. What is the effective tempt. coeff. of combination ?
Solution. Resistance of 600 Ω resistor at 50°C is = 600 [1 + 0.001 (50 − 20)] = 618 Ω
Similarly, resistance of 300 Ω resistor at 50°C is = 300 [1 + 0.004 (50 − 20)] = 336 Ω
Hence, total resistance of combination at 50°C is = 618 + 336 = 954 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Let β = resistance-temperature coefficient at 20°C
Now, combination resistance at 20°C = 900 Ω
Combination resistance at 50°C = 954 Ω
∴ 954 = 900 [ 1 + β (50 − 20)] ∴ β = 0.002

required resistor. All data are referred to the same temperature.
Solution. Let R and R be the resistances of suitable lengths of materials A and B respectively

Example 1.18. A coil has a resistance of 18 Ω when its mean temperature is 20°C and of 20 Ω
when its mean temperature is 50°C. Find its mean temperature rise when its resistance is 21 Ω and
the surrounding temperature is 15° C. (Elect. Technology, Allahabad Univ.)
Solution. Let R be the resistance of the coil and α its tempt. coefficient at 0°C.

Then, 18 = R (1 + α × 20) and 20 = R (1 + 50 α)

If t°C is the temperature of the coil when its resistance is 21 Ω, then,

Example 1.19. The coil of a relay takes a current of 0.12 A when it is at the room temperature
of 15°C and connected across a 60-V supply. If the minimum operating current of the relay is 0.1 A,
calculate the temperature above which the relay will fail to operate when connected to the same
supply. Resistance-temperature coefficient of the coil material is 0.0043 per°C at 6°C.
Solution. Resistance of the relay coil at 15°C is R = 60/0.12 = 500 Ω.
15
Let t°C be the temperature at which the minimum operating current of 0.1 A flows in the relay
coil. Then, R = 60/0.1 = 600 Ω.

Now R = R (1 + 15 α) = R (1 + 15 × 0.0043) and R = R (1 + 0.0043 t)
15 0 0 0 t 0
∴ R t = 1+0.0043t or 600 = 1+0.0043t ∴ t = 65.4°C
R 1.0654 500 1.0645
15
If the temperature rises above this value, then due to increase in resistance, the relay coil will
draw a current less than 0.1 A and, therefore, will fail to operate.
Example 1.20. Two conductors, one of copper and the other of iron, are connected in parallel
and carry equal currents at 25°C. What proportion of current will pass through each if the tempera-
ture is raised to 100°C ? The temperature coefficients of resistance at 0°C are 0.0043/°C and 0.0063/
°C for copper and iron respectively. (Principles of Elect. Engg. Delhi Univ.)
Solution. Since the copper and iron conductors carry equal currents at 25°C, their resistances
are the same at that temperature. Let each be R ohm.
For copper, R = R = R [1 + 0.0043 (100 − 25)] = 1.3225 R
100 1
For iron, R = R = R [1 + 0.0063 (100 − 25)] = 1.4725 R
100 2
If I is the current at 100°C, then as per current divider rule, current in the copper conductor is16 Electrical Technology

I = I 2 =I =0.5268I

R 1.3225R
I = I 2 =I =0.4732I

Hence, copper conductor will carry 52.68% of the total current and iron conductor will carry the
balance i.e. 47.32%.

of filament is necessary if the lamp is to dissipate 60 watts at a filament tempt. of 2420°C ?

1.13. Ohm’s Law
This law applies to electric to electric conduction through good conductors and may be stated
as follows :
The ratio of potential difference (V) between any two points on a conductor to the current (I)
flowing between them, is constant, provided the temperature of the conductor does not change.
V V
In other words, = constant or = R
I I
where R is the resistance of the conductor between the two points considered.
Put in another way, it simply means that provided R is kept constant, current is directly propor-
tional to the potential difference across the ends of a conductor. However, this linear relationship
between V and I does not apply to all non-metallic conductors. For example, for silicon carbide, the
relationship is given by V = KIm where K and m are constants and m is less than unity. It also does not
apply to non-linear devices such as Zener diodes and voltage-regulator (VR) tubes.
Example 1.23. A coil of copper wire has resistance of 90 Ω at 20°C and is connected to a 230-
V supply. By how much must the voltage be increased in order to maintain the current consant if the
temperature of the coil rises to 60°C ? Take the temperature coefficient of resistance of copper as
0.00428 from 0°C.
Solution. As seen from Art. 1.10
R 1+60×0.00428
60 = ∴ R = 90 × 1.2568/1.0856 = 104.2 Ω
R 1+20×0.00428 60
20
Now, current at 20°C = 230/90 = 23/9 A
Since the wire resistance has become 104.2 Ω at 60°C, the new voltage required for keeping the
current constant at its previous value = 104.2 × 23/9 = 266.3 V
∴ increase in voltage required = 266.3 − 230 = 36.3 V
Example 1.24. Three resistors are connected in series across a
12-V battery. The first resistor has a value of 1 Ω, second has a
voltage drop of 4 V and the third has a power dissipation of 12 W.
Calculate the value of the circuit current.
Solution. Let the two unknown resistors be R and R and I the

∴ I2 R 3 =12 and IR 3 = 4 ∴ R 3 = 3 4 R 2 2. Also, I = R 4

Now, I (1 + R + R ) = 12

R 4 1+ R 2 + 3 4 R 2 2 = 12 or 3R 2 2 − 8 R 2 + 4 = 0

1.14. Resistance in Series
When some conductors having resistances R , R and R etc. are joined end-on-end as in Fig.
1 2 3
1.12, they are said to be connected in series. It can be proved that the equivalent resistance or total
resistance between points A and D is equal to the sum of the three individual resistances. Being a
series circuit, it should be remembered that (i) current is the same through all the three conductorsElectric Current and Ohm’s Law 19
(ii) but voltage drop across each is different due to its different resistance and is given by Ohm’s Law
and (iii) sum of the three voltage drops is equal to the voltage applied across the three conductors.
There is a progressive fall in potential as we go from point A to D as shown in Fig. 1.13.
Fig. 1.12 Fig. 1.13
∴ V = V + V + V = IR + IR + IR —Ohm’s Law

But V = IR

As seen from above, the main characteristics of a series circuit are :
1. same current flows through all parts of the circuit.
2. different resistors have their individual voltage drops.
3. voltage drops are additive.
4. applied voltage equals the sum of different voltage drops.
5. resistances are additive.
6. powers are additive.
1.15.Voltage Divider Rule
Since in a series circuit, same current flows through each of the
given resistors, voltage drop varies directly with its resistance. In
Fig. 1.14 is shown a 24-V battery connected across a series combina-
tion of three resistors.
Total resistance R = R + R + R = 12 Ω

According to Voltage Divider Rule, various voltage drops are :

1.16. Resistances in Parallel
Three resistances, as joined in Fig. 1.15 are said to be connected
in parallel. In this case (i) p.d. across all resistances is the same
(ii) current in each resistor is different and is given by Ohm’s
Law and (iii) the total current is the sum of the three separate
currents.

The main characteristics of a parallel circuit are :
1. same voltage acts across all parts of the circuit
2. different resistors have their individual current.
3. branch currents are additive.
4. conductances are additive.
5. powers are additive.
Example 1.25. What is the value of the unknown resistor R in Fig. 1.16 if the voltage drop across
the 500 Ω resistor is 2.5 volts ? All resistances are in ohm. (Elect. Technology, Indore Univ.)
Fig. 1.16
Solution. By direct proportion, drop on 50 Ω resistance = 2.5 × 50/500 = 0.25 V
Drop across CMD or CD = 2.5 + 0.25 = 2.75 V
Drop across 550 Ω resistance = 12 − 2.75 = 9.25 V
I = 9.25/550 = 0.0168 A, I = 2.5/500 = 0.005 A
2
I = 0.0168 − 0.005 = 0.0118 A
1
∴ 0.0118 = 2.75/R; R = 233 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Example 1.26. Calculate the effective resistance of the following combination of resistances
and the voltage drop across each resistance when a P.D. of 60 V is applied between points A and B.
Solution. Resistance between A and C (Fig. 1.17).
= 6 || 3 = 2 Ω
Resistance of branch ACD = 18 + 2 = 20 Ω
Now, there are two parallel paths between points A
and D of resistances 20 Ω and 5 Ω.
Hence, resistance between A and D = 20 || 5 = 4 Ω
∴ Resistance between A and B = 4 + 8 = 12 Ω
Total circuit current = 60/12 = 5 A

Current in branch ACD =

∴ P.D. across 3 Ω and 6 Ω resistors = 1 × 2 = 2 V
P.D. across 18 Ω resistors = 1 × 18 = 18 V
P.D. across 5 Ω resistors = 4 × 5 = 20 V
P.D. across 8 Ω resistors = 5 × 8 = 40 V
Example 1.27. A circuit consists of four 100-W lamps connected in parallel across a 230-V
supply. Inadvertently, a voltmeter has been connected
in series with the lamps. The resistance of the voltmeter
is 1500 Ω and that of the lamps under the conditions
stated is six times their value then burning normally.
What will be the reading of the voltmeter ?
Solution. The circuit is shown in Fig. 1.18. The
wattage of a lamp is given by :
W = I2 R = V2/R
∴ 100 = 2302/R ∴ R = 529 Ω Fig.1.18
Resistance of each lamp under stated condition is = 6 × 529 = 3174 Ω
Equivalent resistance of these four lamps connected in parallel = 3174/4 = 793.5 Ω
This resistance is connected in series with the voltmeter of 1500 Ω resistance.
∴ total circuit resistance = 1500 + 793.5 = 2293.5Ω
∴ circuit current = 230/2293.5 A
According to Ohm’s law, voltage drop across the voltmeter = 1500 × 230/2293.5 = 150 V (approx)
Example 1.28. Determine the value of R and current through it in Fig. 1.19, if current through
branch AO is zero. (Elect. Engg. & Electronics, Bangalore Univ.)
Solution. The given circuit can be redrawn as shown in Fig. 1.19 (b). As seen, it is nothing else
but Wheatstone bridge circuit. As is well-known, when current through branch AO becomes zero, the
bridge is said to be balanced. In that case, products of the resistances of opposite arms of the bridge
become equal.
∴ 4 × 1.5 = R × 1; R = 6 Ω
Fig.1.19
Under condition of balance, it makes no difference if resistance X is removed thereby giving us
the circuit of Fig. 1.19 (c). Now, there are two parallel paths between points B and C of resistances
(1 + 1.5) = 2.5 Ω and (4 + 6) = 10 Ω. R = 10 || 2.5 = 2 Ω.
BC
Total circuit resistance = 2 + 2 = 4 Ω. Total circuit current = 10/4 = 2.5 A
This current gets divided into two parts at point B. Current through R is
y = 2.5 × 2.5/12.5 = 0.5 A22 Electrical Technology
Example 1.29. In the unbalanced bridge circuit of Fig. 1.20 (a), find the potential difference
that exists across the open switch S. Also, find the current which will flow through the switch when
it is closed.
Solution. With switch open, there are two parallel branches across the 15-V supply. Branch
ABC has a resistance of (3 + 12) = 15 Ω and branch ABC has a resistance of (6 + 4) = 10 Ω. Obviously,
each branch has 15 V applied across it.
V = 12 × 15/15 = 12 V; V = 4 × 15/(6 + 4) = 6 V
B D
∴ p.d. across points B and D = V − V = 12 − 6 = 6 V
B D
When S is closed, the circuit becomes as shown in Fig. 1.20 (b) where points B and D become
electrically connected together.
R = 3 || 6 = 2 Ω and R = 4 || 12 = 3 Ω
AB BC
R = 2 + 3 = 5 Ω ; I = 15/5 = 3 A
AC
Fig. 1.20
Current through arm AB = 3 × 6/9 = 2 A. The voltage drop over arm AB = 3 × 2 = 6 V. Hence,
drop over arm BC = 15 − 6 = 9 V. Current through BC = 9/12 = 0.75 A. It is obvious that at point
B, the incoming current is 2 A, out of which 0.75 A flows along BC, whereas remaining 2 − 0.75 =
1.25A passes through the switch.
As a check, it may be noted that current through AD = 6/6 = 1 A. At point D, this current is
joined by 1.25 A coming through the switch. Hence, current through DC = 1.25 + 1 = 2.25 A. This
fact can be further verified by the fact that there is a voltage drop of 9 V across 4 Ω resistor thereby
giving a current of 9/4 = 2.25 A.
Example 1.30. A 50-ohm resistor is in parallel with 100-ohm resistor. Current in 50-ohm
resistor is 7.2 A. How will you add a third resistor and what will be its value of the line-current is to
be its value if the line-current is to be 12.1 amp ? [Nagpur Univ., Nov. 1997]
Solution. Source voltage = 50 × 7.2 = 360 V, Current through 100–ohm resistor = 3.6 A
Total current through these two resistors in parallel = 10.8 A
For the total line current to be 12.1 A, third resistor must be connected in parallel, as the third
branch, for carrying (12.1 − 10.8) = 1.3 A. If R is this resistor R = 360/1.3 = 277 ohms
Example 1.31. In the circuit shown in Fig. 1.21,
calculate the value of the unknown resistance R and
the current flowing through it when the current in
branch OC is zero.
[Nagpur Univ., April 1996]
Solution. If current through R-ohm resistor is I
amp, AO branch carries the same current, since, current
through the branch CO is zero. This also means that
the nodes C and O are at the equal potential. Then,
equating voltage-drops, we have V = V .
AO AC
This means branch AC carries a current of 4I. Fig. 1.21Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 23
This is current of 4 I also flows through the branch CB. Equating the voltage-drops in branches
OB and CB,
1.5 × 4 I =R I, giving R = 6 Ω
At node A, applying KCL, a current of 5 I flows through the branch BA from B to A. Applying KVL
around the loop BAOB, I = 0.5 Amp.
Example 1.32. Find the values of R and V in Fig.

1.22. Also find the power supplied by the source.
[Nagpur University, April 1998]
Solution. Name the nodes as marked on Fig. 1.22.
Treat node A as the reference node, so that V = 0. Since
A
path ADC carries 1 A with a total of 4 ohms resistance,
V = + 4 V.
C
Since V + 4, I = 4/8 = 0.5 amp from C to A.
CA CA
Applying KCL at node C, I = 1.5 A from B to C.
BC
Along the path BA, 1 A flows through 7–ohm resistor.
Fig. 1.22
V = + 7 Volts. V = 7 − 4 = + 3.
B BC
This drives a current of 1.5 amp, through R ohms. Thus R = 3/1.5 = 2 ohms.
Applying KCL at node B, I = 2.5 A from F to B.
FB
V = 2 × 2.5 = 5 volts, F being higher than B from the view-point of Potential. Since V has
FB B
already been evaluated as + 7 volts, V + 12 volts (w.r. to A). Thus, the source voltage V = 12 volts.

Example 1.33. In Fig. 1.23 (a), if all the resistances are of 6 ohms, calculate the equivalent resis-
tance between any two diagonal points. [Nagpur Univ. April 1998]
Fig. 1.23 (a) Fig. 1.23 (b) Fig. 1.23 (c)
Solution. If X-Y are treated as the concerned diagonal points, for evaluating equivalent resis-
tance offered by the circuit, there are two ways of transforming this circuit, as discussed below :
Method 1 : Delta to Star conversion applicable to the delta of PQY introducing an additional
node N as the star-point. Delta with 6 ohms at each side is converted as 2 ohms as each leg of the
star-equivalent. This is shown in Fig. 1.23 (b), which is further simplified in Fig. 1.23 (c). After
handling series-parallel combinations of resistances,
Fig. 1.23 (d) Fig. 1.23 (e)
Total resistance between X and Y terminals in Fig. 1.23 (c) comes out to be 3 ohms.24 Electrical Technology
Method 2 : Star to Delta conversion with P as the star-point and XYQ to be the three points of
concerned converted delta. With star-elements of 6 ohms each, equivalent delta-elements will be 18
ohms, as Fig. 1.23 (d). This is included while redrawing the circuit as in Fig. 1.23 (e).
After simplifying, the series-parallel combination results into the final answer as R = 3 ohms.

After rearranging the terms, 3 I − 2 I = 7, 2 I + 6 I = − 7
A B A B
This gives I = 2 amp, I = − 0.5 amp.

1.17. Types of Resistors
(a) Carbon Composition
It is a combination of carbon particles and a binding resin with different proportions for provid-
ing desired resistance. Attached to the ends of the resistive element are metal caps which have axial
leads of tinned copper wire for soldering the resistor into a circuit. The resistor is enclosed in a
plastic case to prevent the entry of moisture and other harmful elements from outside. Billions of
carbon composition resistors are used in the electronic industry every year. They are available in
power ratings of 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1 and 2 W, in voltage ratings of 250, 350 and 500 V. They have low
failure rates when properly used.
Such resistors have a tendency to produce electric noise due to the current passing from one
carbon particle to another. This noise appears in the form of a hiss in a loudspeaker connected to a
hi-fi system and can overcome very weak signals. That is why carbon composition resistors are used
where performance requirements are not demanding and where low cost in the main consideration.
Hence, they are extensively used in entertainment electronics although better resistors are used in
critical circuits.
(b) Deposited Carbon
Deposited carbon resistors consist of ceramic rods which have a carbon film deposited on them.
They are made by placing a ceramic rod in a methane-filled flask and heating it until, by a gas-
cracking process, a carbon film is deposited on them. A helix-grinding process forms the resistive
path. As compared to carbon composition resistors, these resistors offer a major improvement in
lower current noise and in closer tolerance. These resistors are being replaced by metal film and
metal glaze resistors.
(c) High-Voltage Ink Film
These resistors consist of a ceramic base on which a special resistive ink is laid down in a helical
band. These resistors are capable of withstanding high voltages and find extensive use in cathode-ray
circuits, in radar and in medical electronics. Their resistances range from 1 kΩ to 100,000 MΩ with
voltage range upto 1000 kV.
(d) Metal Film
Metal film resistors are made by depositing vaporized metal in vacuum on a ceramic-core rod.
The resistive path is helix-ground as in the case of deposited carbon resistors. Metal film resistors
have excellent tolerance and temperature coefficient and are extrememly reliable. Hence, they are
very suitable for numerous high grade applications as in low-level stages of certain instruments although
they are much more costlier.28 Electrical Technology
(e) Metal Glaze
A metal glaze resistor consists of a metal glass mixture which is applied as a thick film to a
ceramic substrate and then fired to form a film. The value of resistance depends on the amount of
metal in the mixture. With helix-grinding, the resistance can be made to vary from 1 Ω to many mega-
ohms.
Another category of metal glaze resistors consists of a tinned oxide film on a glass substrate.
(f) Wire-wound
Wire-wound resistors are different from all other types in the sense that no film or resistive
coating is used in their construction. They consist of a ceramic-core wound with a drawn wire having
accurately-controlled characteristics. Different wire alloys are used for providing different resistance
ranges. These resistors have highest stability and highest power rating.
Because of their bulk, high-power ratings and high cost, they are not suitable for low-cost or
high-density, limited-space applications. The completed wire-wound resistor is coated with an insu-
lating material such as baked enamel.
(g) Cermet (Ceramic Metal)
The cermet resistors are made by firing certain metals blended with ceramics on a ceramic sub-
strate. The value of resistance depends on the type of mix and its thickness. These resistors have very
accurate resistance values and show high stability even under extreme temperatures. Usually, they
are produced as small rectangles having leads for being attached to printed circuit boards (PCB).
1.18. Nonlinear Resistors
Those elements whose V − I curves are not straight lines are called nonlinear elements because
their resistances are nonlinear resistances. Their V − I characteristics can be represented by a suitable
equation.
Examples of nonlinear elements are filaments of incandescent lamps, diodes, thermistors and
varistors. A varistor is a special resistor made of carborundum crystals held together by a binder.
Fig. 1.37 (a) shows how current through a varistor increase rapidly when the applied voltage increases
beyond a certain amount (nearly 100 V in the present case).
Fig. 1.37
There is a corresponding rapid decrease in resistance when the current increases. Hence, varis-
tors are generally used to provide over-voltage protection in certain circuits.
A thermistor is made of metallic oxides in a suitable binder and has a large negative coefficient
of resistance i.e., its resistance decreases with increase in temperature as shown in Fig. 1.30 (b). Fig.
1.30 (c) shows how the resistance of an incandescent lamp increases with voltage whereas Fig. 1.30
(d) shows the V-I characteristics of a typical silicon diode. For a germanium diode, current is related
to its voltage by the relation.
I = I (eV/0.026 − 1)
oElectric Current and Ohm’s Law 29
1.19.Varistor (Nonlinear Resistor)
It is a voltage-dependent metal-oxide material whose resistance decreases sharply with increas-
ing voltage. The relationship between the current flowing through a varistor and the voltage applied
across it is given by the relation : i = ken where i = instantaneous current, e is the instantaneous voltage
and η is a constant whose value depends on the metal oxides used. The value of η for silicon-carbide-
based varistors lies between 2 and 6 whereas zinc-oxide-based varistors have a value ranging from 25
to 50.
The zinc-oxide-based varistors are primarily used for protecting solid-state power supplies from
low and medium surge voltage in the supply line. Silicon-carbide varistors provide protection against
high-voltage surges caused by lightning and by the discharge of electromagnetic energy stored in the
magnetic fields of large coils.
1.20.Short and Open Circuits
When two points of circuit are connected together by a thick metallic wire (Fig. 1.38), they are said
to be short-circuited. Since ‘short’ has practically zero resistance, it gives rise to two important facts :
(i) no voltage can exist across it because V = IR = I × 0 = 0
(ii) current through it (called short-circuit current) is very large (theoretically, infinity)
Fig. 1.38 Fig. 1.39
Two points are said to be open-circuited when there is no direct connection between them
(Fig.1.39). Obviously, an ‘open’ represents a break in the continuity of the circuit. Due to this break
(i) resistance between the two points is infinite.
(ii) there is no flow of current between the two points.
1.21.‘Shorts’ in a Series Circuit
Since a dead (or solid) short has almost zero resistance, it causes the problem of excessive current
which, in turn, causes power dissipation to increase many times and circuit components to burn out.
Fig. 1.4030 Electrical Technology
In Fig. 1.40 (a) is shown a normal series circuit where
V = 12 V, R = R + R + R = 6 Ω
1 2 3
I = V/R = 12/6 = 2 A, P = I2R = 22 × 6 = 24 W
In Fig. 1.40 (b), 3-Ω resistor has been shorted out by a resistanceless copper wire so that R =0.
Now, total circuit resistance R= 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 Ω. Hence, I = 12/3 = 4 A and P = 42 × 3 = 48 W CD .
Fig. 1.40 (c) shows the situation where both 2 Ω and 3 Ω resistors have been shorted out of the
circuit. In this case,
R = 1 Ω, I = 12/1 = 12 A and P = 122 × 1 = 144 W
Because of this excessive current (6 times the normal value), connecting wires and other circuit
components can become hot enough to ignite and burn out.
1.22. ‘Opens’ in a Series Circuit
In a normal series circuit like the one shown in Fig. 1.41 (a), there exists a current flow and the
voltage drops across different resistors are proportional to their resistances. If the circuit becomes
‘open’ anywhere, following two effects are produced :
(i) since ‘open’ offers infinite resistance, circuit current becomes zero. Consequently, there is
no voltage drop across R and R .
1 2
(ii) whole of the applied voltage
(i.e. 100 V in this case) is felt across the
‘open’ i.e. across terminals A and B
[Fig. 1.41 (b)].
The reason for this is that R and R
1 2
become negligible as compared to the
infinite resistance of the ‘open’ which has
practicallly whole of the applied voltage
dropped across it (as per Voltage Divider
Rule of art. 1.15). Hence, voltmeter in
Fig. 1.41 Fig. 1.41 (b) will read nearly 100 V i.e.
the supply voltage.
1.23.‘Opens’ in a Parallel Circuit
Since an ‘open’ offers infinite resistance, there would be no current in that part of the circuit
where it occurs. In a parallel circuit, an ‘open’ can occur either in the main line or in any parallel branch.
As shown in Fig. 1.42 (a), an open in the main line prevents flow of current to all branches.
Hence, neither of the two bulbs glows. However, full applied voltage (i.e. 220 V in this case) is
available across the open.
Fig. 1.42
In this Fig. 1.42 (b), ‘open’ has occurred in branch circuits of B . Since there is no current in this
1
branch, B will not glow. However, as the other bulb remains connected across the voltage supply, it
1
would keep operating normality.Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 31
It may be noted that if a voltmeter is connected across the open bulb, it will read full supply
voltage of 220 V.
1.24.‘Shorts’ in Parallel Circuits
Suppose a ‘short’ is placed across R (Fig. 1.43). It becomes directly connected across the
3
battery and draws almost infinite current because not only its own resistance but that of the connect-
ing wires AC and BD is negligible. Due to this excessive current, the wires may get hot enough to
burn out unless the circuit is protected by a fuse.
Fig. 1.43
Following points about the circuit of Fig. 1.43 (a) are worth noting.
1. not only is R short-circuited but both R and R are also shorted out i.e. short across one
3 1 2
branch means short across all branches.
2. there is no current in shorted resistors. If there were three bulbs, they will not glow.
3. the shorted components are not damaged, For example, if we had three bulbs in Fig. 1.43
(a), they would glow again when circuit is restored to normal conditions by removing the
short-circuited.
It may, however, be noted from Fig. 1.43 (b) that a short-circuit across R may short out R but
3 2
not R since it is protected by R .
1 4
1.25. Division of Current in Parallel Circuits
In Fig. 1.44, two resistances are joined in parallel across a voltage V. The current in each branch,
as given in Ohm’s law, is
I = V/R and I = V/R
1 1 2 2
I R
∴ 1 = 1
I R
2 2
I I
As = G and = G
R 1 R 2
1 2
I G
∴ 1 = 1
I G
2 2
Hence, the division of current in the branches of a parallel
circuit is directly proportional to the conductance of the branches
or inversely proportional to their resistances. We may also
Fig. 1.44
express the branch currents in terms of the total circuit current

Example 1.37. A resistance of 10 Ω is connected in series with two resistances each of 15 Ω
arranged in parallel. What resistance must be shunted across
this parallel combination so that the total current taken shall
be 1.5 A with 20 V applied ?
(Elements of Elect. Engg.-1; Banglore Univ.)
Solution. The circuit connections are shown in Fig. 1.46.
Drop across 10-Ω resistor = 1.5 × 10 = 15 V
Drop across parallel combination, V = 20 − 15 = 5 V

Hence, voltage across each parallel resistance is 5 V.

Example 1.41. Two conductors, one of copper and the other of iron, are connected in parallel
and at 20°C carry equal currents. What proportion of current will
pass through each if the temperature is raised to 100°C ? Assume
α for copper as 0.0042 and for iron as 0.006 per °C at 20°C. Find
also the values of temperature coefficients at 100°C.
(Electrical Engg. Madras Univ. )
Solution. Since they carry equal current at 20°C, the two con-
ductors have the same resistance at 20°C i.e. R . As temperature is
20
raised, their resistances increase through unequally.
For Cu, R = R (1 + 80 × 0.0042) = 1.336 R
100 20 20
For iron R′ = R (1 + 80 × 0.006) = 1.48 R

As seen from Art. 1.25, current through Cu conductor is

I = I× 100 =I× 20 =0.5256I or 52.56% of I

Hence, current through Cu conductor is 52.56 per cent of the total current. Obviously, the re-
maining current i.e. 47.44 per cent passes through iron.

Example 1.42. A battery of unknown e.m.f. is con-
nected across resistances as shown in Fig. 1.50. The volt-
age drop across the 8 Ω resistor is 20 V. What will be the
current reading in the ammeter ? What is the e.m.f. of the
battery ?(Basic Elect. Engg.; Bangladesh Univ., 1990)
Solution.Current through 8 Ω resistance = 20/8 =2.5A
This current is divided into two parts at point A; one
part going along path AC and the other along path ABC
which has a resistance of 28 Ω.
I = 2.5× 11 = 0.7
2 (11+28)
Hence, ammeter reads 0.7 A.
Resistance between A and C = (28 × 11/39) ohm. Fig. 1.50
Total circuit resistance = 8 + 11 + (308/39) = 1049/39 Ω
∴ E = 2.5 × 1049/39 = 67.3 V
1.26. Equivalent Resistance
The equivalent resistance of a circuit (or network) between its any two points (or terminals) is
given by that single resistance which can replace the entire given circuit between these two points. It
should be noted that resistance is always between two given points of a circuit and can have differentElectric Current and Ohm’s Law 35
values for different point-pairs as illustrated by Example 1.42. it can usually be found by using series
and parallel laws of resistances. Concept of equivalent resistance is essential for understanding
network theorems like Thevenin’s theorem and Norton’s theorem etc. discussed in Chapter 2.
Example 1.43. Find the equivalent resistance of the circuit given in Fig. 1.51 (a) between the
following points (i) A and B (ii) C and D (iii) E and F (iv) A and F and (v) A and C. Numbers
represent resistances in ohm.
Solution. (i) Resistance Between A and B
In this case, the entire circuit to the right side of AB is in parallel with 1 Ω resistance connected
directly across points A and B.
Fig. 1.51
As seen, there are two parallel paths across points C and D; one having a resistance of 6 Ω and
the other of (4 + 2) = 6 Ω. As shown in Fig. 1.51 (c), the combined resistance between C and D is
=6|| 6 = 3 Ω. Further simplifications are shown in Fig. 1.51 (d) and (e). As seen, R = 5/6 ΩΩΩΩΩ.
AD
(ii) Resistance between C and D
As seen from Fig. 1.51 (a), there are three parallel paths between C and D (i) CD itself of 6 Ω
(ii) CEFD of (4 + 2) = 6 Ω and (iii) CABD of (2 + 1) = 3 Ω. It has been shown separately in Fig. 1.52
(a). The equivalent resistance R = 3 || 6 || 6 = 1.5 Ω as shown in Fig. 1.52 (b).
CD
(iii) Resistance between E and F
In this case, the circuit to the left side of EF is in parallel with the 2 Ω resistance connected
directly across E and F. This circuit consists of a 4 Ω resistance connected in series with a parallel
Fig. 1.52 Fig. 1.53
circuit of 6 || (2 + 1) = 2 Ω resistance. After various simplifications as shown in Fig. 1.53,
R = 2 ||6 = 1.5 ΩΩΩΩΩ.
EF36 Electrical Technology

(iv) Resistance Between A and F
As we go from A and F, there are two possible routes to begin with : one along ABDF and the other
along AC. At point C, there are again two alternatives, one along CDF and the other along CEF.
As seen from Fig. 1.54 (b), R = 6 || 6 = 3 Ω. Further simplification of the original circuit as
CD
shown in Fig. 1.54 (c), (d) and (e) gives R = 5/6 ΩΩΩΩΩ.
AF
(v) Resistance Between A and C
In this case, there are two parallel paths between A and C ; one is directly from A to C and the
other is along ABD. At D, there are again two parallel paths to C; one is directly along DC and the
other is along DFEC.
Fig. 1.55
As seen from Fig. 1.55 (b), R = 6 || 6 = 3 Ω. Again, from Fig. 1.55 (d), R = 2 || 4 = 4/3 ΩΩΩΩΩ.

Example 1.44. Two resistors of values 1 kΩ and 4 Ω are connected in series across a constant
voltage supply of 100 V. A voltmeter having an internal resistance of 12 kΩ is connected across the
4 kΩ resistor. Draw the circuit and calculate
(a) true voltage across 4 kΩ resistor before the voltmeter was connected.
(b) actual voltage across 4kΩ resistor after the voltmeter is connected and the voltage recorded
by the voltmeter.
(c) change in supply current when voltmeter is con-
nected.
(d) percentage error in voltage across 4 kΩ resistor.
Solution. (a) True voltage drop across 4 kΩ resistor as
found by voltage-divider rule is 100 × 4/5 = 80 V
Current from the supply = 100/(4 + 1) = 20 mA
(b) In Fig. 1.56, voltmeter has been joined across the
4 kΩ resistor. The equivalent resistance between B and

The reduction in the value of voltage being measured in called voltmeter loading effect because
voltmeter loads down the circuit element across which it is connected. Smaller the voltmeter resis-
tance as compared to the resistance across which it is connected, greater the loading effect and,
hence, greater the error in the voltage reading. Loading effect cannot be avoided but can be mini-
mized by selecting a voltmeter of resistance much greater than that of the network across which it is
connected.
Example 1.45. In the circuit of Fig. 1.57, find the value of supply voltage V so that 20-Ω
resistor can dissipate 180 W.
Solution. I 2 × 20 = 180 W; I = 3 A

Since 15 Ω and 20 Ω are in parallel,
I × 15 = 3 × 20 ∴ I = 4 A

Now, resistance of the circuit to the right of point A is
= 10 + 15 × 20/35 = 130/7 Ω
∴ I × 25 = 7 × 130/7

∴ I = 26/5 A = 5.2 A

∴ I = I 1 + I 2 = 5.2 + 7 = 12.2 A Fig. 1.57

which produces a current of 0.25 A in the 3 Ω resistor. All resistances are in ohm.
Solution. We will assume a current of 1 A in the 3 Ω resistor. The voltage necessary to produce
1 A bears the same ratio to 1 A as V does to 0.25 A because of the linearity of the network. It is

1.27. Duality Between Series and Parallel Circuits
There is a certain peculiar pattern of relationship between series and parallel circuits. For
example, in a series circuit, current is the same whereas in a parallel circuit, voltage is the same.
Also, in a series circuit, individual voltages are added and in a parallel circuit, individual currents
are added. It is seen that while comparing series and parallel circuits, voltage takes the place of
current and current takes the place of voltage. Such a pattern is known as “duality” and the two
circuits are said to be duals of each other.
As arranged in Table 1.4 the equations involving voltage, current and resistance in a series circuit
have a corresponding dual counterparts in terms of current, voltage and conductance for a parallel
circuit.

It is the voltage of one point in a circuit with respect to that of another point (usually called the
reference or common point).
Consider the circuit of Fig. 1.83 (a) where
the most negative end-point C has been taken as
the reference. With respect to point C, both points
A and B are positive though A is more positive
thanB. The voltage of point B with respect to
that of C i.e. V = + 30 V.
BC
Similarly, V = + (20 + 30) = + 50 V.
AC
In Fig. 1.83 (b), the most positive end point
A has been taken as the reference point. With
respect to A, both B and C are negative though C
is more negative than B.
V = −20 V, V = −(20 + 30) = −50 V
BA CA
In Fig. 1.83 (c), mid-point B has been taken
Fig. 1.83
as the reference point. With respect to B, A is at
positive potential whereas C is at a negative potential.
Hence, V = + 20 V and V = − 30 V (of course, V = + 30 V)
AB CB BC
It may be noted that any point in the circuit can be chosen as the refer-
ence point to suit our requirements. This point is often called ground or
earth because originally it meant a point in a circuit which was actually
connected to earth either for safety in power systems or for efficient radio
reception and transmission. Although, this meaning still exists, yet it has
become usual today for ‘ground’ to mean any point in the circuit which is
Fig. 1.84 connected to a large metallic object such as the metal chassis of a transmit-Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 43
ter, the aluminium chassis of a receiver, a wide strip of copper plating on a printed circuit board,
frame or cabinet which supports the whole equipment. Sometimes, reference point is also called
common point. The main advantage of using a ground system is to simplify our circuitry by saving
on the amount of wiring because ground is used as the return path for may circuits. The three com-
monly-used symbols for ground are shown in Fig. 1.84.
Example 1.48. In Fig. 1.85, calculate the values of (i) V (ii) V and (iii) V .
AF EA FB
Solution. It should be noted that V stands for the
AF
potential of point A with respect to pointF. The easiest
way of finding it is to start from the reference point F
and go to point A along any available path and calculate
the algebraic sum of the voltages met on the way. Start-
ing from point F as we go to point A, we come across
different battery voltages. Taking the sign convention
given in Art. 1.28, we get Fig. 1.85
(i) V = − 24 + 4 + 8 − 6 + 12 = − 6 V
AF
The negative sign shows that point A is negative with respect to point F by 6 V.
(ii) Similarly, V = − 12 + 6 − 8 − 4 = − 18 V
EA
(iii) Starting from point B, we get V = 6 − 8 − 4 + 24 = 18 V.
FB
Since the result is positive it means that point F is at a higher potential than point B by 18 V.
Example 1.49. In Fig. 1.86 compute the relative potentials of points A, B, C, D and E which
(i) point A is grounded and (ii) point D is grounded. Does it affect the circuit operation or potential
difference between any pair of points ?
Solution. As seen, the two batteries have been connected in series opposition. Hence, net
circuit voltage = 34 − 10 = 24 V
Total circuit resistance = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 Ω
Hence, the circuit current = 24/12 = 2 A
Drop across 2 Ω resistor = 2 × 2 = 4 V, Drop across 4 Ω resistor = 2 × 4 = 8 V
Drop across 6 Ω resistor = 2 × 6 = 12 V
Fig. 1.86 Fig. 1.87
(i) Since point B is directly connected to the positive terminal of the battery whose negative
terminal is earthed, hence V = + 34 V.
B
Since there is a fall of 4 V across 2 Ω resistor, V = 34 − 4 = 30 V
C
As we go from point C to D i.e. from positive terminal of 10-V battery to its negative terminal,
there is a decrease in potential of 10 V. Hence, V = 30 − 10 = 20 i.e. point D is 20 V above the
D
ground A.
Similarly, V = V − voltage fall across 4 Ω resistor = 20 − 8 = + 12 V
E D44 Electrical Technology
Also V = V − fall across 6 Ω resistor = 12 (2 × 6) = 0 V
A E
(ii) In Fig. 1.87, point D has been taken as the ground. Starting from point D, as we go to E there
is a fall of 8 V. Hence, V = −−−−− 8 V. Similarly, V = − (8 + 12) = −−−−− 20 V.
E A
As we go from A to B, there is a sudden increase of 34 V because we are going from negative
terminal of the battery to its positive terminal.
∴ V = − 20 + 34 = + 14 V
B
V = V − voltage fall across 2 Ω resistor = 14 − 4 = + 10 V.
C B
It should be so because C is connected directly to the positive terminal of the 10 V battery.
Choice of a reference point does not in any way affect the operation of a circuit. Moreover, it
also does not change the voltage across any resistor or between any pair of points (as shown below)
because the ground current i = 0.

Example 1.50. Find the voltage V in Fig. 1.88 (a). All resistances are in ohms.
Solution. The given circuit can be simplified to the final form shown in Fig. 1.88 (d). As seen,
current supplied by the battery is 1 A. At point A in Fig. 1.88 (b), this current is divided into two equal
parts of 0.5 A each.
Obviously, voltage V represents the potential of point B with respect to the negative terminal of
the battery. Point B is above the ground by an amount equal to the voltage drop across the series
combination of (40 + 50) = 90 Ω.
V = 0.5 × 90 = 45 V.

1.29.Voltage Divider Circuit
A voltage divider circuit (also called poten-
tial divider) is a series network which is used to
feed other networks with a number of different
voltages and derived from a single input voltage
source.
Fig. 1.89 (a) shows a simple voltage divider
circuit which provides two output voltages
V andV . Since no load is connected across the
1 2
output terminals, it is called an unloaded voltage
divider. Fig. 1.89Electric Current and Ohm’s Law 45
As seen from Art. 1.15.

V = V 1 and V =V . 2

The ratio V /V is also known as voltage-ratio transfer function.

The voltage divider of Fig. 1.89 (b) can be used to get six different voltages :
V = V , V = V , V = V , V = (V + V ), V = (V + V ) and V = V

Example 1.51. Find the values of different voltages that can be obtained from a 12-V battery
with the help of voltage divider circuit of Fig. 1.90.
Solution. R = R + R + R = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 Ω
1 2 3
Drop across R = 12 × 4/8 = 6 V
1
∴ V = 12 − 6 = 6 V above ground
B
Drop across R = 12 × 3/8 = 4.5 V
2
∴ V = V − 4.5 = 6 − 4.5 = 1.5
C B
Drop across R = 12 × 1/8 = 1.5 V
3
Different available load voltages are :
(i) V = V − V = 12 − 6 = 6 V
AB A B
(ii) V = 12 − 1.5 = 10.5 V (iii) V = 12 V
AC AD
(iv) V = 6 − 1.5 = 4.5 V (v) V = 1.5 V Fig. 1.90
BC CD
Example 1.52. What are the output voltages of the unloaded voltage divider shown in Fig.
1.91? What is the direction of current through AB ?
Solution. It may be remembered that both V and V are with respect
1 2
to the ground.
R = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 Ω
∴ V = drop across R
1 2
= 24 × 4/12 = + 8 V
V = drop across R = − 24 × 2/12 = −−−−− 4 V
2 3
It should be noted that point B is at negative potential with respect
to the ground.
Current flows from A to B i.e. from a point at a higher potential to a
point at a lower potential. Fig. 1.91
Example 1.53. Calculate the potentials of point A, B, C and D in Fig. 1.92. What would be the
new potential values if connections of 6-V battery are reversed ? All resistances are in ohm.
Solution. Since the two batteries are connected in additive series, total voltage around the cir-
cuit is = 12 + 6 = 18 V. The drops across the three resistors as found by the voltage divider rule as
shown in Fig. 1.92 (a) which also indicates their proper polarities. The potential of any point in the
circuit can be found by starting from the ground point G (assumed to be at 0V) and going to the point
either in clockwise direction or counter-clockwise direction. While going around the circuit, the rise
in potential would be taken as positive and the fall in potential as negative. (Art. 2.3). Suppose we
start from point G and proceed in the clockwise direction to point A. The only potential met on the
way is the battery voltage which is taken as positive because there is a rise of potential since we are
going from its negative to positive terminal. Hence, V is + 12 V.
A
V = 12 − 3 = 9 V; V = 12 − 3 − 6 = 3 V
B C46 Electrical Technology
Similarly, V = 12 − 3 − 6 − 9 = − 6 V.
D
It is also obvious that point D must be at − 6 V because it is directly connected to the negative
terminal of the 6-V battery.
We would also find the
potentials of various points by
starting from point G and go-
ing in the counter-clockwise
direction. For example, V =
B
− 6 + 9 + 6 = 9 V as before.
The connections of the 6
− V battery have been reversed
in Fig. 1.92 (b). Now, the net
voltage around the circuit is 12
− 6 = 6 V. The drop over the 1
Ω resistor is = 6 × 1/(1 + 2 +
3) = 1 V; Drop over 2 Ω
resistor is = 6 × 2/6 = 2 V.
Obviously, V = + 12 V, V =
A B
12 − 1 = 11 V, V = 12 − 1 − 2 Fig. 1.92
C
= 9 V. Similarly, V = 12 −
D
1 − 2 − 3 = + 6 V.
Example 1.54. Using minimum
number of components, design a
voltage divider which can deliver 1
W at 100 V, 2 W at − 50 V and 1.6 W
at − 80 V. The voltage source has an
internal resistance of 200 Ω and
supplies a current of 100 mA. What
is the open-circuit voltage of the
voltage source ? All resistances are
in ohm.
Solution. From the given load
conditions, the load currents are as
follows :
I = 1/100 = 10 mA,
L1
I = 2/50 = 40 mA,
L2
I = 1.6/80 = 20 mA Fig. 1.93
L3
For economising the number of
components, the internal resistance
of 200 Ω can be used as the series dropping resistance. The suitable circuit and the ground connec-
tion are shown in Fig. 1.93.
Applying Kirchhoff’s laws to the closed circuit ABCDA, we have
V − 200 × 100 × 10 −3 − 100 − 80 = 0 or V = 200 V
I = 100 − 10 = 90 mA ∴ R = 100 V/90 mA = 1.11 kΩΩΩΩΩ
1 1
I = 100 − 20 = 80 mA; voltage drop across R = − 50 − (− 80) = 30 V
3 3
∴ R = 30 V/80 mA = 375 Ω
3
I + 40 = 80 ∴ I = 40 mA; R = 50 V/40 mA = 1.25 kΩΩΩΩΩ

2.1. Electric Circuits and Network Theorems
There are certain theorems, which when applied to the solutions of electric networks, wither
simplify the network itself or render their analytical solution very easy. These theorems can also be
applied to an a.c. system, with the only difference that impedances replace the ohmic resistance of
d.c. system. Different electric circuits (according to their properties) are defined below :
1. Circuit. A circuit is a closed conducting path through which an electric current either flows
or is intended flow.
2. Parameters. The various elements of an electric circuit are called its parameters like resis-
tance, inductance and capacitance. These parameters may be lumped or distributed.
3. Liner Circuit. A linear circuit is one whose parameters are constant i.e. they do not change
with voltage or current.
4. Non-linear Circuit. It is that circuit whose parameters change with voltage or current.
5. Bilateral Circuit. A bilateral circuit is one whose properties or characteristics are the same
in either direction. The usual transmission line is bilateral, because it can be made to per-
form its function equally well in either direction.
6. Unilateral Circuit. It is that circuit whose properties or characteristics change with the
direction of its operation. A diode rectifier is a unilateral circuit, because it cannot perform
rectification in both directions.
7. Electric Network. A combination of various electric elements, connected in any manner
whatsoever, is called an electric network.
8. Passive Network is one which contains no source of e.m.f. in it.
9. Active Network is one which contains one or more than one source of e.m.f.
10. Node is a junction in a circuit where two or more circuit elements are connected together.
11. Branch is that part of a network which lies between two junctions.
12. Loop. It is a close path in a cir-
cuit in which no element or node
is encountered more than once.
13. Mesh. It is a loop that contains
no other loop within it. For ex-
ample, the circuit of Fig. 2.1 (a)
has even branches, six nodes,
three loops and two meshes
whereas the circuit of Fig. 2.1 (b)
has four branches, two nodes, six
loops and three meshes.
It should be noted that, unless stated
otherwise, an electric network would be
assumed passive in the following treat-
ment.
We will now discuss the various net-
work theorems which are of great help in
solving complicated networks. Inciden- Standard symbols
tally, a network is said to be completelyDC Network Theorems 53
solved or analyzed when all voltages and all currents in its different elements are determined.
Fig. 2.1
There are two general approaches to network analysis :
(i) Direct Method
Here, the network is left in its original form while determining its different voltages and currents.
Such methods are usually restricted to fairly simple circuits and include Kirchhoff’s laws, Loop
analysis, Nodal analysis, superposition theorem, Compensation theorem and Reciprocity theorem
etc.
(ii) Network Reduction Method
Here, the original network is converted into a much simpler equivalent circuit for rapid calcula-
tion of different quantities. This method can be applied to simple as well as complicated networks.
Examples of this method are : Delta/Star and Star/Delta conversions.
Thevenin’s theorem and Norton’s Theorem etc.
2.2. Kirchhoff’s Laws *
These laws are more comprehensive than Ohm’s law and are
used for solving electrical networks which may not be readily solved
by the latter. Kirchhoff’s laws, two in number, are particularly useful
(a) in determining the equivalent resistance of a complicated net-
work of conductors and (b) for calculating the currents flowing in the
various conductors. The two-laws are :
1. Kirchhoff’s Point Law or Current Law (KCL)
Kirchhoff
It states as follows :
in any electrical network, the algebraic sum of the currents meeting at a point (or junction) is
zero.
Put in another way, it simply means that the total current leaving a junction is equal to the total
current entering that junction. It is obviously true because there is no accumulation of charge at the
junction of the network.
Consider the case of a few conductors meeting at a point A as in Fig. 2.2 (a). Some conductors
have currents leading to point A, whereas some have currents leading away from point A. Assuming
the incoming currents to be positive and the outgoing currents negative, we have
I + (− I ) + (− I ) + (+ I ) + (− I ) = 0
1 2 3 4 5
or I + I − I − I − I = 0 or I + I = I + I + I
1 4 2 3 5 1 4 2 3 5
or incoming currents = outgoing currents
* After Gustave Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), an outstanding German Physicist.54 Electrical Technology
Similarly, in Fig. 2.2 (b) for node A
+ I + (− I ) + (− I ) + (− I ) + (− I ) = 0 or I= I + I + I + I
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
We can express the above conclusion thus : Σ I = 0 ....at a junction
Fig. 2.2
2. Kirchhoff’s Mesh Law or Voltage Law (KVL)
It states as follows :
The algebraic sum of the products of currents and resistances in each of the conductors in
any closed path (or mesh) in a network plus the algebraic sum of the e.m.fs. in that path is zero.
In other words, Σ IR + Σ e.m.f. = 0 ...round a mesh
It should be noted that algebraic sum is the sum which takes into account the polarities of the
voltage drops.

(b) and (c) Kirchhoff’s Current Law Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
The basis of this law is this : If we start from a particular junction and go round the mesh till we
come back to the starting point, then we must be at the same potential with which we started. Hence,
it means that all the sources of e.m.f. met on the way must necessarily be equal to the voltage drops in
the resistances, every voltage being given its proper sign, plus or minus.
2.3. Determination of Voltage Sign
In applying Kirchhoff’s laws to specific problems, particular attention should be paid to the
algebraic signs of voltage drops and e.m.fs., otherwise results will come out to be wrong. Following
sign conventions is suggested :
(a) Sign of Battery E.M.F.
A rise in voltage should be given a + ve sign and a fall in voltage a −ve sign. Keeping this inDC Network Theorems 55
mind, it is clear that as we go from the −ve terminal of a battery to its +ve terminal (Fig. 2.3), there is
a rise in potential, hence this voltage should be given a + ve sign. If, on the other hand, we go from
+ve terminal to −ve terminal, then there is a fall in potential, hence this voltage should be preceded
Fig. 2.3 Fig. 2.4
by a −ve sign. It is important to note that the sign of the battery e.m.f. is independent of the
direction of the current through that branch.
(b) Sign of IR Drop
Now, take the case of a resistor (Fig. 2.4). If we go through a resistor in the same direction as the
current, then there is a fall in potential because current flows from a higher to a lower potential.
Hence, this voltage fall should be taken −ve. However, if we go in a direction opposite to that of the
current, then there is a rise in voltage. Hence, this voltage rise should be given a positive sign.
It is clear that the sign of voltage drop across a resistor depends on the direction of current
through that resistor but is independent of the polarity of any other source of e.m.f. in the circuit
under consideration.
Consider the closed path ABCDA in Fig. 2.5. As we travel around the mesh in the clockwise
direction, different voltage drops will have the following
signs :
I R is − ve (fall in potential)
1 2
I R is − ve (fall in potential)
2 2
I R is + ve (rise in potential)
3 3
I R is − ve (fall in potential)
4 4
E is − ve (fall in potential)
2
E is + ve (rise in potential)
1
Using Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we get
− I R − I R − I R − I R − E + E = 0
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 2 1
or I R + I R − I R + I R = E − E
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 2
Fig. 2.5
2.4. Assumed Direction of Current
In applying Kirchhoff’s laws to electrical networks, the question of assuming proper direction of
current usually arises. The direction of current flow may be assumed either clockwise or anticlockwise.
If the assumed direction of current is not the actual direction, then on solving the quesiton, this
current will be found to have a minus sign. If the answer is positive, then assumed direction is the
same as actual direction (Example 2.10). However, the important point is that once a particular
direction has been assumed, the same should be used throughout the solution of the question.
Note. It should be noted that Kirchhoff’s laws are applicable both to d.c. and a.c. voltages and
currents. However, in the case of alternating currents and voltages, any e.m.f. of self-inductance or
that existing across a capacitor should be also taken into account (See Example 2.14).56 Electrical Technology
2.5. Solving Simultaneous Equations
Electric circuit analysis with the help of Kirchhoff’s laws usually involves solution of two or
three simultaneous equations. These equations can be solved by a systematic elimination of the
variables but the procedure is often lengthy and laborious and hence more liable to error. Determi-
nants and Cramer’s rule provide a simple and straight method for solving network equations through
manipulation of their coefficients. Of course, if the number of simultaneous equations happens to be
very large, use of a digital computer can make the task easy.
2.6. Determinants
a b
The symbol is called a determinant of the second order (or 2 × 2 determinant) because
c d
it contains two rows (ab and cd) and two columns (ac and bd). The numbers a, b, c and d are called
the elements or constituents of the determinant. Their number in the present case is 22 = 4.
The evaluation of such a determinant is accomplished by cross-multiplicaiton is illustrated
below :

The above result for a second order determinant can be remembered as
upper left times lower right minus upper right times lower left
a b c
The symbol a 1 b 1 c 1 represents a third-order determinant having 32 = 9 elements. It may

be evaluated (or expanded) as under :
1. Multiply each element of the first row (or alternatively, first column) by a determinant ob-
tained by omitting the row and column in which it occurs. (It is called minor determinant or
just minor as shown in Fig. 2.6).
Fig. 2.6
2. Prefix + and − sing alternately to the terms so obtained.
3. Add up all these terms together to get the value of the given determinant.
Considering the first column, minors of various elements are as shown in Fig. 2.6.
Expanding in terms of first column, we get

2.7. Solving Equations with Two Unknowns
Suppose the two given simultaneous equations are
ax + by = c
dx + ey = f
Here, the two unknown are x and y, a, b, d and e are coefficients of these unknowns whereas c and
f are constants. The procedure for solving these equations by the method of determinants is as fol-
lows :
1. Write the two equations in the matrix form as
⎡a b⎤⎡x⎤

⎡c⎤
⎢⎣d e⎥⎦⎢⎣y⎥⎦ ⎢⎣f⎥⎦
2. The common determinant is given as Δ = ⎡ ⎢⎣d a b e ⎤ ⎥⎦ =ae−bd
3. For finding the determinant for x, replace the co- c b

Let the three simultaneous equations be as under :
ax + by + cz = d
ex + fy + gz = h

The above equations can be put in the matrix form as under :
⎡a b c⎤ ⎡x⎤ ⎡d⎤
⎢

⎣j k l⎦ ⎣z⎦ ⎢⎣m⎥⎦
The value of common determinant is given by
a b c
Δ = e f g =a(fl −gk)−e(bl−ck)+ j(bg −cf)
j k l
The determinant for x can be found by replacing coefficients of x in the original matrix by the
constants.
d b c
∴ Δ = h f g =d (fl− gk)−h(bl−ck)+m(bg −cf)

Similarly, determinant for y is given by replacing coefficients of y with the three constants.
a d c
Δ = e h g =a(hl−mg)−e(dl−mc)+ j(dg −hc)

In the same way, determinant for z is given by

Example 2.4. What is the voltage V across the open switch in the circuit of Fig. 2.7 ?
s
Solution. We will apply KVL to find V. Starting from point A in the clockwise direction and
s
using the sign convention given in Art. 2.3, we have
Fig. 2.7 Fig. 2.8
+V + 10 − 20 − 50 + 30 = 0 ∴ V = 30 V
s s
Example 2.5. Find the unknown voltage V in the circuit of Fig. 2.8.
1
Solution. Initially, one may not be clear regarding the solution of this question. One may think
of Kirchhoff’s laws or mesh analysis etc. But a little thought will show that the question can be solved
by the simple application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Taking the outer closed loop ABCDEFA and
applying KVL to it, we get
− 16 × 3 − 4 × 2 + 40 − V = 0 ; ∴ V = −−−−− 16 V
1 1
The negative sign shows there is a fall in potential.
Example 2.6. Using Kirchhoff’s Current Law and Ohm’s Law, find the magnitude and polarity
of voltge V in Fig. 2.9 (a).
Directions of the two current
sources are as shown.
Solution. Let us arbitrarily
choose the directions of I , I and
1 2
I and polarity of V as shown in

Fig. 2.9.(b). We will use the sign
convention for currents as given
in Art. 2.3. Applying KCL to
node A, we have
Fig. 2.960 Electrical Technology
− I + 30 + I − I − 8 = 0
1 2 3
or I − I + I = 22 ...(i)
1 2 3
Applying Ohm’s law to the three resistive branches in Fig. 2.9 (b), we have
I =
V
,I
=V
,I
=−V
(Please note the − ve sign.)
1 2 3 4 2 6
Substituting these values in (i) above, we get
V − ⎛ ⎜ −V ⎞ ⎟+V = 22 or V = 24 V
2 ⎝ 6 ⎠ 4
∴ I = V/2 = 24/2 = 12 A, I = − 24/6 = − 4 A, I = 24/4 = 6 A
1 2 3
The negative sign of I indicates that actual direction of its flow is opposite to that shown in Fig.
2
2.9 (b). Actually, I , flows from A to B and not from B to A as shown.

Incidentally, it may be noted that all currents are outgoing except 30A which is an incoming
current.
Example 2.7. For the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10, find V and V .
CE AG
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. Consider the two battery circuits of Fig. 2.10 separately. Current in the 20 V battery
circuit ABCD is 20 (6 + 5 + 9) = 1A. Similarly,
current in the 40 V battery curcuit EFGH is =
40/(5 + 8 + 7) = 2A. Voltage drops over differ-
ent resistors can be found by using Ohm’s law.
For finding V i.e. voltage of point C with
CE
respect to point E, we will start from point E
and go to C via points H and B. We will find
the algebraic sum of the voltage drops met on
the way from point E to C. Sign convention of
the voltage drops and battery e.m.fs. would be
Fig. 2.10
the same as discussed in Art.2.3.
∴ V = (− 5 × 2) + (10) − (5 × 1) = − 5V
CE
The negative sign shows that point C is negative with respect to point E.
V = (7 × 2) + (10) + (6 × 1) = 30 V.
AG
The positive sign shows that point A is at a positive
potential of 30 V with respect to point G.

Multiplying (1) by 2 and subtracting (2) from it, we get
− y + 17z = 0 ...(4)
Similarly, multiplying (1) by 5 and subtracitng (3) from it, we have
− 12y + 22z = − 2 or − 6y + 11z = − 1 ...(5)
Eliminating y from (4) and (5), we have 91z = 1 or z = 1/91 A
From (4); y = 17/91 A. Putting these values of y and z in (1), we get x = 30/91 A

x + 3y = 10 ...(v)
Subtracting Eq. (v) from (iv), we get

Solution. Let the current distribution be as shown in the figure. Considering the close circuit

across the external resistance.
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. Applying KVL to the closed circuit
Fig. 2.13
ABCDA of Fig. 2.13, we get
− 12 + 2x − 1y + 8 = 0 or 2x − y = 4 ...(i)
Similarly, from the closed circuit ADCEA, we get
− 8 + 1y + 10 (x + y) = 0 or 10x + 11y = 8 ...(ii)
From Eq. (i) and (ii), we get
x = 1.625 A and y = −−−−− 0.75 A
The negative sign of y shows that the current is flowing into the 8-V battery and not out of it. In
other words, it is a charging current and not a discharging current.
Current flowing in the external resistance = x + y = 1.625 − 0.75 = 0.875 A
P.D. across the external resistance = 10 × 0.875 = 8.75 V
Note. To confirm the correctness of the answer, the simple check is to find the value of the
external voltage available across point A and C with the help of the two parallel branches. If the value
of the voltage comes out to be the same, then the answer is correct, otherwise it is wrong. For
example, V = − 2 × 1.625 + 12 = 8.75 V. From the second branch V = 1 × 0.75 + 8 = 8.75 V.

In Fig. 2.17 (c), the transformed equivalent circuit is shown. The 3-amp current source (O to A)
and the current of 1.588 amp in A-O branch have to be interpreted with reference to the actual circuit,
shown in Fig. 2.17 (d), where in a node D exists at a potential of 12 volts w.r. to the reference node.
The 4-ohm resistor between D and A carries an upward current of {(12 − 6.353)/4 =} 1.412 amp,
which is nothing but 3 amp into the node and 1.588 amp away from the node, as in Fig. 2.17 (c), at
node A. The current in the 12-V source is thus 1.412 amp.

2.9. Independent and Dependent Sources
Those voltage or current sources, which do not depend on any other quantity in the circuit, are
called independent sources. An independent d.c. voltage source is shown in Fig. 2.20 (a) whereas a
time-varying voltage source is shown in Fig. 2.20 (b). The positive sign shows that terminal A is
positive with respect to terminal B. In other words, potential of terminal A is v volts higher than that
of terminal B.
Fig. 2.20

Δ = −0.5 1.5 0 =1.25, Δ = 2 1.5 0 =2.5
2 −1 0 1.0 1 1 0 1
Similarly, Fig. 2.20 (c) shows an ideal constant current source whereas Fig. 2.20 (d) depicts a
time-varying current source. The arrow shows the direction of flow of the current at any moment
under consideration.
A dependent voltage or current source is one which depends on some other quantity in the circuit
which may be either a voltage or a current. Such a source is represented by a diamond-shaped symbol
as shown in Fig. 2.21 so as not to confuse it with an independent source. There are four possible
dependent sources :
1. Voltage-dependent voltage source [Fig. 2.21 (a)]
2. Current-dependent voltage source [Fig. 2.21 (b)]
3. Voltage-dependent current source [Fig. 2.21 (c)]
4. Current-dependent current source [Fig. 2.21 (d)]
Such sources can also be either constant sources or time-varying sources. Such sources are often
met in electronic circuits. As seen above, the voltage or current source is dependent on the and is
Fig. 2.21
proportional to another current or voltage. The constants of proportionality are written as a, r, g and
β. The constants a and β have no unis, r has the unit of ohms and g has the unit of siemens.DC Network Theorems 71
Independent sources actually exist as physical entities such as a battery, a d.c. generator and an
alternator etc. But dependent sources are parts of models that are used to represent electrical proper-
ties of electronic devices such as operational amplifiers and transistors etc.
Example 2.19. Using Kirchhoff’s current law, find the values of the currents i and i in the
1 2
circuit of Fig. 2.22 (a) which contains a current-dependent current source. All resistances are in
ohms.
Solution. Applying KCL to node A, we get
2 − i + 4 i − i = 0 or − 3i + i = 2
1 1 2 1 2
By Ohm’s law, i = v/3 and i = v/2
1 2
Substituting these values above, we get
− 3(v/3) + v/2 = 2 or v = − 4 V
∴ i = − 4/3 A and i = − 4/2 = − 2 A
1 2
The value of the dependent current source is = 4i = 4 × (− 4/3) = − 16/3 A.
1
Fig. 2.22
Since i and i come out to be negative, it means that they flow upwards as shown in Fig. 2.22(b)
1 2
and not downwards as presumed. Similarly, the current of the dependent source flows downwards as
shown in Fig. 2.22 (b). It may also be noted that the sum of the upwards currents equals that of the
downward currents.
Example 2.20. By applying Kirchhoff’s current law, obtain the values of v, i and i in the circuit
1 2
of Fig. 2.23 (a) which contains a voltage-dependent current source. Resistance values are in ohms.
Solution. Applying KCL to node A of the circuit, we get
2 − i + 4v − i = 0 or i + i − 4v = 2
1 2 1 2
Now, i = v/3 and i = v/6
∴ v + v −4v

∴ i = A and i A and 4v 4 V

Fig. 2.2372 Electrical Technology
Since i and i come out to be negative and value of current source is also negative, their direc-
1 2
tions of flow are opposite to those presumed in Fig. 2.23 (a). Actual current directions are shown in
Fig. 2.23 (b).
Example 2.21. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law, to find the values of current i and the voltage
drops v and v in the circuit of Fig. 2.24 which contains a current-dependent voltage source. What
1 2
is the voltage of the dependent source ? All resistance values are in ohms.
Solution. Applying KVL to the circuit of Fig. 2.24 and starting from point A, we get
− v + 4i − v + 6 = 0 or v − 4i + v = 6
1 2 1 2
Now, v = 2i and v = 4i
1 2
∴ 2i − 4i + 4i = 6 or i = 3A
∴ v = 2 × 3 = 6V and v = 4 × 3 = 12 V
1 2
Fig. 2.24 Fig. 2.25
Voltage of the dependent source = 4i = 4 × 4 = 12 V
Example 2.22. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.25, apply KCL to find the value of i for the case
when (a) v = 2 V, (b) v = 4 V (c) v = 6 V. The resistor values are in ohms.
Solution. (a) When v = 2 V, current through 2 Ω resistor which is connected in parallel with the
2 v source = 2/2 = 1A. Since the source current is 2 A, i = 2 − 1 = 1 A.
(b) When v = 4V, current through the 2Ω resistor = 4/2 = 2 A. Hence i = 2 − 2 = 0 A.
(c) When v = 6 V, current through the 2Ω resistor = 6/2 = 3 A. Since current source can supply
only 2 A, the balance of 1 A is supplied by the voltage source. Hence, i = − 1 A i.e. it flows in a
direction opposite to that shown in Fig. 2.25.
Example 2.23. In the circuit of Fig. 2.26, apply KCL
to find the value of current i when (a) K = 2 (b) K = 3 and
(c) K = 4. Both resistances are in ohms.
Solution. Since 6 Ω and 3 Ω resistors are connected in
parallel across the 24-V battery, i = 24/6 = 4 A.
1
Applying KCL to node A, we get i − 4 + 4 K − 8 = 0 or
i = 12 − 4 K.
(a) When K = 2, i = 12 − 4 × 2 = 4 A Fig. 2.26
(b) When K = 3, i = 12 − 4 × 3 = 0 A
(c) When K = 4, i = 12 − 4 × 4 = − 4 A
It means that current i flows in the opposite direciton.
Example 2.24. Find the current i and also the power and voltage of the dependent source in
Fig. 2.72 (a). All resistances are in ohms.DC Network Theorems 73
Solution. The two current sources can be combined into a single source of 8 − 6 = 2 A. The two
parallel 4 Ω resistances when combined have a value of 2 Ω which, being in series with the 10 Ω
resistance, gives the branch resistance of 10 + 2 = 12 Ω. This 12 Ω resistance when combined with
the other 12 Ω resistance gives a combination resistance of 6 Ω. The simplified circuit is shown in
Fig. 2.27 (b.)
Fig. 2.27
Applying KCL to node A, we get
0.9i + 2 − i − V/6 = 0 or 0.6i = 12 − v
Also v = 3i ∴ i = 10/3 A. Hence, v = 10 V.
The power furnished by the current source = v × 0.9 i = 10 × 0.9 (10/3) = 30 W.
Example 2.25. By using voltage-divider rule, calculate the voltages v and v in the network
x y
shown in Fig. 2.28.
Solution. As seen, 12 V drop in over
the series combination of 1, 2 and 3 Ω re-
sistors. As per voltage-divider rule v = drop
x
over 3 Ω = 12 × 3/6 = 6 V.
The voltage of the dependent source =
12 × 6 = 72 V.
The voltage v equals the drop across 8
y
Ω resistor connected across the voltage
source of 72V.
Again using voltge-divider rule, drop
over 8 Ω resistor = 72 × 8/12 = 48 V. Fig. 2.28
Hence, v = − 48 V. The negative sign
y
has been given because positive and negative signs of
v are actually opposite to those shown in Fig. 2.28.
y
Example 2.26. Use KCL to find the value of v in
the circuit of Fig. 2.29.
Solution. Let us start from ground and go to point
a and find the value of voltage v . Obviously, 5 + v =

v or v = v − 5. Applying KCL to point, we get
a a
6 − 2 v + (5 − v )/1 = 0 or 6 − 2 (v − 5) +

(5 − v ) = 0 or v = 7 V
a a
Hence, v = v − 5 = 7 − 5 = 2 V. Since it turns out

Now, applying KVL to the closed loop, we get 24 − v − 2v − 2i = 0. Since v = 2i, we get 24 − 2i −

2.10. Maxwell’s Loop Curent Method
This method which is particularly well-suited to coupled circuit solutions employs a system of
loop or mesh currents instead of branch currents (as in Kirchhoff’s laws). Here, the currents in
different meshes are assigned continuous paths so that they do not split at a junction into branch
currents. This method eliminates a great deal of tedious work involved in the branch-current method
and is best suited when energy sources are voltage sources rather than current sources. Basically, this
method consists of writing loop voltage equations by Kirchhoff’s voltage law in terms of unknown
loop currents. As will be seen later, the number of independent equations to be solved reduces from
b by Kirchhoff’s laws to b − (j − 1) for the loop current method where b is the number of branches and
j is the number of junctions in a given network.
Fig. 2.51 shows two batteries E and E
1 2
connected in a network consisting of five
resistors. Let the loop currents for the
three meshes be I , I and I . It is obvious
1 2 3
that current through R (when considered
4
as a part of the first loop) is (I − I ) and
1 2
that through R is (I − I ). However,
S 2 3
when R is considered part of the second
4
loop, current through it is (I − I ).
2 1
Similarly, when R is considered part of
5
the third loop, current through it is
(I − I ). Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage

E − I R − R (I − I ) = 0 or I (R + R ) − I R − E = 0 ...loop 1

The above three equations can be solved not only to find loop currents but branch currents as
well.
2.11. Mesh Analysis Using Matrix Form
Consider the network of Fig. 2.52, which contains
resistances and independent voltage sources and has three
meshes. Let the three mesh currents be designated as I , I
1 2
and I and all the three may be assumed to flow in the
3
clockwise direction for obtaining symmetry in mesh
equations.
Applying KVL to mesh (i), we have
E − I R − R (I − I ) − R (I − I ) = 0
1 1 1 3 1 3 2 1 2
or (R + R + R ) I − R I − R I = E ...(i)
1 2 3 1 2 2 3 3 1
Similarly, from mesh (ii), we have
E − R (I − I ) − R (I − I ) − I R = 0
2 2 2 1 5 2 3 2 4 Fig. 2.52
or − R I + (R + R + R ) I − R I = E ...(ii)
2 1 2 4 5 2 5 3 2
Applying KVL to mesh (iii), we have
E − I R − R (I − I ) − R (I − I ) − I R = 0
3 3 7 5 3 2 3 3 1 3 6
or − R I − R I + (R + R + R + R ) I = E ...(iii)
3 1 5 2 3 5 6 7 3 3
It should be noted that signs of different items in the above three equations have been so changed
as to make the items containing self resistances positive (please see further).
The matrix equivalent of the above three equations is
⎡+(R + R + R ) − R − R ⎤ ⎡I ⎤ ⎡E ⎤
⎢ 1 − R 2 3 +(R + R 2 + R ) − R 3 ⎥ ⎢ I 1⎥=⎢ E 1⎥
⎢ 2 2 4 5 5 ⎥ ⎢ 2⎥ ⎢ 2⎥
⎣ − R − R +(R + R + R + R )⎦ ⎣I ⎦ ⎣E ⎦
3 5 3 5 6 7 3 3
It would be seen that the first item is the first row i.e. (R + R + R ) represents the self resistance
1 2 3
of mesh (i) which equals the sum of all resistance in mesh (i). Similarly, the second item in the first
row represents the mutual resistance between meshes (i) and (ii) i.e. the sum of the resistances com-
mon to mesh (i) and (ii). Similarly, the third item in the first row represents the mutual-resistance of
the mesh (i) and mesh (ii).
The item E , in general, represents the algebraic sum of the voltages of all the voltage sources
1
acting around mesh (i). Similar is the case with E and E . The sign of the e.m.f’s is the same as
2 3
discussed in Art. 2.3 i.e. while going along the current, if we pass from negative to the positive
terminal of a battery, then its e.m.f. is taken positive. If it is the other way around, then battery e.m.f.
is taken negative.
In general, let
R = self-resistance of mesh (i)
11
R = self-resistance of mesh (ii) i.e. sum of all resistances in mesh (ii)
22
R = Self-resistance of mesh (iii) i.e. sum of all resistances in mesh (iii)
33
R = R = − [Sum of all the resistances common to meshes (i) and (ii)] *
12 21
R = R = − [Sum of all the resistances common to meshes (ii) and (iii)]*
23 32
* Although, it is easier to take all loop currents in one direction (Usually clockwise), the choice of direcion for any
loop current is arbitrary and may be chosen independently of the direction of the other loop currents.80 Electrical Technology
R = R = − [Sum of all the resistances common to meshes (i) and (iii)] *

Using these symbols, the generalized form of the above matrix equivalent can be written as

R R R I = E

If there are m independent meshes in any liner network, then the mesh equations can be written in
the matrix form as under :

The above equations can be written in a more compact form as [R ] [I ] = [E ]. It is known as
m m m
Ohm’s law in matrix form.
In the end, it may be pointed out that the directions of mesh currents can be selected arbitrarily.
If we assume each mesh current to flow in the clockwise direction, then
(i) All self-resistances will always be postive and (ii) all mutual resistances will always be
negative. We will adapt this sign convention in the solved examples to follow.
The above main advantage of the generalized form of all mesh equations is that they can be
easily remembered because of their symmetry. Moreover, for any given network, these can be written
by inspection and then solved by the use of determinants. It eliminates the tedium of deriving simul-
taneous equations.

2.12. Nodal Analysis With Sources
The node-equation method is based directly on Kirchhoff’s current law unlike loop-current method
which is based on Kirchhoff’s voltage law. However, like loop current method, nodal method also
has the advantage that a minimum
number of equations need be written to
determine the unknown quantities.
Moreover, it is particularly suited for
networks having many parallel circuits
with common ground connected such as
electronic circuits.
For the application of this method,
every junction in the network where three
or more branches meet is regarded a
Fig. 2.60
node. One of these is regarded as the
reference node or datum node or zero-potential node. Hence the number of simultaneous equations
to be solved becomes (n − 1) where n is the number of independent nodes. These node equations
often become simplified if all voltage sources are converted into current sources (Art. 2.12).
(i) First Case
Consider the circuit of Fig. 2.60 which has three nodes. One of these i.e. node 3 has been taken
in as the reference node. V represents the potential of node 1 with reference to the datum node 3.
A
Similarly, V is the potential difference between node 2 and node 3. Let the current directions which
B
have been chosen arbitrary be as shown.
For node 1, the following current equation can be written with the help of KCL.
I = I + I
1 4 2
Now I R = E − V ∴ I = (E − V )/R ...(i)
1 1 1 A 1 1 A 1
Obviously, I = V /R Also, I R = V − V (ä V > V )
4 A 4 2 2 A B A B
∴ I = (V − V )/R

Substituting these values in Eq. (i) above, we get,

Though the above nodal equations (ii) and (iii) seem to be complicated, they employ a very
simple and systematic arrangement of terms which can be written simply by inspection. Eq. (ii) at
node 1 is represented byDC Network Theorems 85
1. The product of node potential V and (1/R + 1/R + 1/R ) i.e. the sum of the reciprocals of

4. All the above set to zero.
Same is the case with Eq. (iii) which applies to node 2.

After finding different node voltages, various currents can be calculated by using Ohm’s law.
(ii) Second Case
Now, consider the case when a third
battery of e.m.f. E is connected between
3
nodes 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 2.62.
It must be noted that as we travel from
node 1 to node 2, we go from the −ve ter-
minal of E to its +ve terminal. Hence,
3
according to the sign convention given in
Art. 2.3, E must be taken as positive.
3
However, if we travel from node 2 to node
1, we go from the +ve to the −ve terminal
Fig. 2.6286 Electrical Technology
of E . Hence, when viewed from node 2, E is taken negative.

It is exactly the same expression as given under the First Case discussed above except for the
additional term involving E . This additional term is taken as +E /R (and not as − E /R ) because
3 3 2 3 2
this third battery is so connected that when viewed from mode 1, it represents a rise in voltage. Had
it been connected the other way around, the additional term would have been taken as −E /R .
3 2
For node 2
I + I − I = 0 or I + I = I − as per KCL
2 3 5 2 3 5
V +E −V E −V V
Now, as before, I = A 3 B,I = 2 B,I = B

∴ A 3 B + 2 B = B

B ⎝R R R ⎠ R R R
2 3 5 3 2 2
As seen, the additional terms is −E /R (and not + E /R ) because as viewed from this node, E
3 2 3 2 3
represents a fall in potential.
It is worth repeating that the additional term in the above Eq. (i) and (ii) can be either +E /R or
3 2
−E /R depending on whether it represents a rise or fall of potential when viewed from the node
3 2
under consideration.

The reason for adding the two battery volt-
ages of 2 V and 4 V is because they are connected

2.13. Nodal Analysis with Current Sources
Consider the network of Fig. 2.68 (a) which has two current sources and three nodes out of which
1 and 2 are independent ones whereas No. 3 is the reference node.
The given circuit has been redrawn for ease of understanding and is shown in Fig. 2.68 (b). The
current directions have been taken on the assumption that
1. both V and V are positive with respect to the reference node. That is why their respective
1 2
curents flow from nodes 1 and 2 to node 3.
2. V is positive with respect to V because current has been shown flowing from node 1 to
1 2
node 2.
A positive result will confirm out assumption whereas a negative one will indicate that actual
direction is opposite to that assumed.
Fig. 2.68
We will now apply KCL to each node and use Ohm’s law to express branch currents in terms of
node voltages and resistances.

The above two equations can also be written by simple inspection. For example, Eq. (i) is
represented by
1. product of potential V and (1/R + 1/R ) i.e. sum of the reciprocals of the branch resistances
1 1 3
connected to this node.
2. minus the ratio of adjoining potential V and the interconnecting resistance R .
2 3
3. all the above equated to the current supplied by the current source connected to this node.
This current is taken positive if flowing into the node and negative if flowing out of it (as per sign
convention of Art. 2.3). Same remarks apply to Eq. (ii) where I has been taken negative because it
2
flows away from node 2.
In terms of branch conductances, the above two equations can be put as
V (G + G ) − V G = I and V (G + G ) − V G = − I

It is obvious that all nodes are at a higher potential with respect to the datum node. The various

taken as the reference node or common ground for all other nodes. We will apply KCL to the three
nodes and taken currents coming towards the nodes as positive and those going away from them as
negative. For example, current going away from node No. 1 is (V − V )/1 and hence would be taken

as negative. Since 4 A current is coming towards node No. 1, it would be taken as positive but 5 A
current would be taken as negative.

2.14. Source Conversion
A given voltage source with a series resistance can be converted into (or replaced by) and equivalent
current source with a parallel resistance. Conversely, a current source with a parallel resistance can
be converted into a vaoltage source with a series resistance. Suppose, we want to convert the voltage
source of Fig. 2.75 (a) into an equivalent current source. First, we will find the value of current
supplied by the source when a ‘short’ is put across in termials A and B as shown in Fig. 2.75 (b). This
current is I = V/R.
A current source supplying this current I and having the same resistance R connected in parallel
with it represents the equivalent source. It is shown in Fig. 2.75 (c). Similarly, a current source of I
and a parallel resistance R can be converted into a voltage source of voltage V = IR and a resistance94 Electrical Technology
Fig. 2.75
R in series with it. It should be kept in mind that a voltage source-series resistance combination is
equivalent to (or replaceable by) a current source-parallel resistance combination if, and only if their
1. respective open-circuit voltages are equal, and
2. respective short-circuit currents are equal.
For example, in Fig. 2.75 (a), voltage across terminals A and B when they are open (i.e. open-
circuit voltage V ) is V itself because there is no drop across R. Short-circuit current across AB = I
OC
= V/R.
Now, take the circuit of Fig. 2.75 (c). The open-circuit voltage across AB = drop across R = IR
= V. If a short is placed across AB, whole of I passes through it because R is completely shorted out.
Example 2.41. Convert the voltage source of Fig. 2.73 (a) into an equivalent current source.
Solution. As shown in Fig 2.76 (b), current obtained by putting a short across terminals A and B
is 10/5 = 2 A.
Hence, the equivalent current source is as shown in Fig. 2.76 (c).
Fig. 2.76
Example 2.42. Find the equivalent volt-
age source for the current source in Fig. 2.77

Solution. The open-circuit voltage across
terminals A and B in Fig. 2.77 (a) is
V = drop across R
OC
= 5 × 2 = 10 V
Hence, voltage source has a voltage of 10 V
and the same resistance of 2 Ω through connected Fig. 2.77
in series [Fig. 2.77 (b)].DC Network Theorems 95
Example 2.43. Use Source Conversion technique to find the load current I in the circuit of Fig.
2.78 (a).
Solution. As shown in Fig. 2.78 (b). 6-V voltage source with a series resistance of 3 Ω has been
converted into an equivalent 2 A current source with 3 Ω resistance in parallel.
Fig. 2.78
The two parallel resistances of 3 Ω and 6 Ω can be combined into a single resistance of 2 Ω as
shown in Fig. 2.79. (a)
The two current sources cannot be combined together because of the 2 Ω resistance present
between points A and C. To remove this hurdle, we convert the 2 A current source into the equivalent
4 V voltage source as shown in Fig. 2.79 (b). Now, this 4 V voltage source with a series resistance of
(2 + 2) = 4 Ω can again be converted into the equivalent current source as shown in Fig. 2.80 (a).
Now, the two current sources can be combined into a single 4-A source as shown in Fig. 2.80 (b).
Fig. 2.79
Fig. 2.80
The 4-A current is divided into two equal parts at point A because each of the two parallel paths
has a resistance of 4 Ω. Hence I = 2 A.

Example 2.44. Calculate the direction and magnitude of the current through the 5 Ω resistor
between points A and B of Fig. 2.81 (a) by using nodal voltage method.
Solution. The first thing is to convert the voltage source into the current sources as shown in
Fig. 2.81 (b). Next, the two parallel resistances of 4 Ω each can be combined to give a single resis-
tance of 2 Ω [Fig. 2.82 (a)]. Let the current directions be as indicated.

Solution. The equivalence is expected for
a load connected to the right-side of terminals A
and B. In this case, the voltage-source has no
resistive element in series. While handling such
cases, the 3-ohm resistor has to be kept aside,
treating it as an independent and separate loop.
This voltage source will circulate a current of
20/3 amp in the resistor, and will not appear in
the calculations.

2.15. Ideal Constant-Voltage Source
It is that voltage source (or generator) whose output voltage remains absolutely constant what-
ever the change in load current. Such a voltage source must possess zero internal resistance so that
internal voltage drop in the source is zero. In that case, output voltage provided by the source would
remain constant irrespective of the amount of current drawn from it. In practice, none such ideal
constant-voltage source can be obtained. However, smaller the internal resistance r of a voltage
source, closer it comes to the ideal sources described above.
Fig. 2.94
Suppose, a 6-V battery has an internal resistance of 0.005 Ω [Fig. 2.94 (a)]. When it supplies no
current i.e. it is on no-load, V = 6 V i.e. output voltage provided by it at its output terminals A and B
o100 Electrical Technology
is 6 V. If load current increases to 100 A, internal drop = 100 × 0.005 = 0.5 V. Hence, V = 6 − 0.5
o
= 5.5 V.
Obviously an output voltage of 5.5 − 6 V can be considered constant as compared to wide
variations in load current from 0 A ot 100 A.
2.16. Ideal Constant-Current Source
It is that voltage source whose internal resistance is infinity. In practice, it is approached by a
source which posses very high resistance as compared to that of the external load resistance. As
shown in Fig. 2.94 (b), let the 6-V battery or voltage source have an internal resistance of 1 M Ω and
let the load resistance vary from 20 K to 200 K. The current supplied by the source varies from
6.1/1.02 = 5.9 μ A to 6/1.2 = 5 μ A. As seen, even when load resistance increases 10 times, current
decreases by 0.9 μA. Hence, the source can be considered, for all practical purposes, to be a constant-
current source.
2.17. Superposition Theorem
Fig. 2.95
According to this theorem, if there are a number of e.m.fs. acting simultaneously in any linear
bilateral network, then each e.m.f. acts independently of the others i.e. as if the other e.m.fs. did not
exist. The value of current in any conductor is the algebraic sum of the currents due to each e.m.f.
Similarly, voltage across any conductor is the algebraic sum of the voltages which each e.m.f would
have produced while acting singly. In other words, current in or voltage across, any conductor of the
network is obtained by superimposing the currents and voltages due to each e.m.f. in the network. It
is important to keep in mind that this theorem is applicable only to linear networks where current is
linearly related to voltage as per Ohm’s law.
Hence, this theorem may be stated as follows :
In a network of linear resistances containing more
than one generator (or source of e.m.f.), the cur-
rent which flows at any point is the sum of all the
currents which would flow at that point if each
generator where considered separately and all the
other generators replaced for the time being by
resistances equal to their internal resistances.
Explanation
In Fig. 2.95 (a) I , I and I represent the values of
Fig. 2.96 1 2DC Network Theorems 101
currents which are due to the simultaneous action of the two sources of e.m.f. in the network. In Fig.
2.95 (b) are shown the current values which would have been obtained if left-hand side battery had
acted alone. Similarly, Fig. 2.96 represents conditions obtained when right-hand side battery acts
alone. By combining the current values of Fig. 2.95 (b) and 2.96 the actual values of Fig. 2.95 (a) can
be obtained.
Obviously, I = I ′ − I ′ ′, I = I ′ ′ − I ´, I = I′ + I′ ′.
1 1 1 2 2 2
Example 2.46. In Fig. 2.95 (a) let battery e.m.fs. be 6 V and 12 V, their internal resistances
0.5 Ω and 1 Ω. The values of other resistances are as indicated. Find the different currents flowing
in the branches and voltage across 60-ohm resistor.
Solution. In Fig. 2.95 (b), 12-volt battery has been removed though its internal resistance of
1 Ω remains. The various currents can be found by applying Ohm’s Law.
It is seen that there are two parallel paths between points A and B, having resistances of 6 Ω and
(2 + 1) = 3 Ω.
∴ equivalent resistance = 3 || 6 = 2 Ω
Total resistance = 0.5 + 2.5 + 2 = 5 Ω ∴ I ′ = 6/5 = 1.2 A.
1
This current divides at point A inversely in the ratio of the resistances of the two parallel paths.
∴ I′ = 1.2 × (3/9) = 0.4 A. Similarly, I ′ = 1.2 × (6/9) = 0.8 A
2
In Fig. 2.96, 6 volt battery has been removed but not its internal resistance. The various currents
and their directions are as shown.
The equivalent resistance to the left to points A and B is = 3 || 6 = 2 Ω
∴ total resistance = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 Ω ∴ I ′ ′ = 12/5 = 2.4 A
2
At point A, this current is divided into two parts,
I′′ = 2.4 × 3/9 = 0.8 A, I ′ ′ = 2.4 × 6/9 = 1.6 A
1
The actual current values of Fig. 2.95 (a) can be obtained by superposition of these two sets of
current values.
∴ I = I ′ − I ′ ′ = 1.2 − 1.6 = − 0.4 A (it is a charging current)
1 1 1
I = I ′′ − I ′ = 2.4 − 0.8 = 1.6 A
2 2 2
I = I′ + I′ ′ = 0.4 + 0.8 = 1.2 A
Voltage drop across 6-ohm resistor = 6 × 1.2 = 7.2 V
Example 2.47. By using Superposition Theorem, find the current in resistance R shown in Fig.
2.97 (a)

across poins A and C. R = 1 || 0.04 = 1 × 0.04/1.04 = 0.038 Ω. This resistance is in series with

CBA and CDA is = 1 || 0.05 = 1 × 0.05/1.05 = 0.048 Ω. Total resistance offered to E is = 0.04 + 0.048
2
= 0.088 Ω. Current I = 2.15/0.088 = 24.4 A. Again, I = 24.4 × 0.05/1.05 = 1.16 A.

To current through 1-Ω resistance when both batteries are present
= I + I = 0.896 + 1.16 = 2.056 A.

Example 2.48. Use Superposition theorem to find current I in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.98 (a).
All resistances are in ohms. (Basic Circuit Analysis Osmania Univ. Jan/Feb 1992)
Solution. In Fig. 2.98 (b), the voltage source has been replaced by a short and the 40 A current
sources by an open. Using the current-divider rule, we get I = 120 × 50/200 = 30 A.
1
In Fig. 2.98 (c), only 40 A current source has been considered. Again, using current-divider rule
I = 40 × 150/200 = 30 A.
2
In Fig. 2.98 (d), only voltage source has been considered. Using Ohm’s law,
I = 10/200 = 0.05 A.
3
Since I and I cancel out, I = I = 0.005 A.

Fig. 2.98
Example 2.49. Use superposition theorem to determine the voltage v in the network of Fig.
2.99(a).
Solution. As seen, there are three independent sources and one dependent source. We will find
the value of v produced by each of the three independent sources when acting alone and add the three
values to find v. It should be noted that unlike independent source, a dependent source connot be set
to zero i.e. it cannot be ‘killed’ or deactivated.
Let us find the value of v due to 30 V source only. For this purpose we will replace current
1
source by an open circuit and the 20 V source by a short circuit as shown in Fig. 2.99 (b). Applying
KCL to node 1, we get
(30−v) v (v/3−v)
1 − 1 + 1 1 = 0 or v = 6 V
6 3 2 1
Let us now keep 5 A source alive and ‘kill’ the other two independent sources. Again applying
KCL to node 1, we get, from Fig. 2.99 (c).DC Network Theorems 103
Fig. 2.99
v v (v /3−v )
2 −5− 2 + 2 2 = 0 or v = − 6 V
6 3 2 2
Let us now ‘kill’ 30 V source and 5 A source and find v
3
due to 20 V source only. The two parallel resistances of 6 Ω
and 3 Ω can be combined into a single resistance of 2 Ω.
Assuming a circulating current of i and applying KVL to the
indicated circuit, we get, from Fig. 2.100.
−2i−20−2i−1 (−2i)=
0 or i = 6 A
3
Hence, according to Ohm’s law, the component of v that Fig. 2.100
corresponds to 20 V source is v = 2 × 6 = 12 V. ∴ v = v
3 1
+ v + v = 6 − 6 + 12 = 12 V.

Example 2.50. Using Superposition theorem, find the current through the 40 W resistor of the
circuit shown in Fig. 2.101 (a). (F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ. May 1990)
Solution. We will first consider when 50 V battery acts alone and afterwards when 10-V battery
is alone in the circuit. When 10-V battery is replaced by short-circuit, the circuit becomes as shown
in Fig. 2.101 (b). It will be seen that the right-hand side 5 Ω resistor becomes connected in parallel
with 40 Ω resistor giving a combined resistance of 5 || 40 = 4.44 Ω as shown in Fig. 101 (c). This 4.44
Ω resistance is in series with the left-hand side resistor of 5 Ω giving a total resistance of
(5 + 4.44) = 9.44 Ω. As seen there are two resistances of 20 Ω and 9.44 Ω connected in parallel. In
Fig. 2.101 (c) current I = 50/9.44 = 5.296 A.
Fig. 2.101
At point A in Fig. 2.101 (b) there are two resistances of 5 Ω and 40 Ω connected in parallel,
hence, current I divides between them as per the current-divider rule. If I is the current flowing

In Fig. 2.102 (a), 10 V battery acts
alone because 50-V battery has been re-
moved and replaced by a short-circuit.
As in the previous case, there are two
parallel branches of resistances 20 Ω and
9.44 Ω across the 10-V battery. Current I
through 9.44 Ω branch is I = 10/9.44 =
1.059 A. This current divides at point B
between 5 Ω resistor and 40 Ω resistor.
Current through 40 Ω resistor I = 1.059 × Fig. 2.102

5/45 = 0.118 A.
According to the Superposition theorem, total current through 40 Ω resistance is
= I + I = 0.589 + 0.118 = 0.707 A.

Example 2.51. Solve for the power delivered to the 10 Ω resistor in the circuit shown in Fig.
2.103 (a). All resistances are in ohms. (Elect. Science - I, Allahabad Univ. 1991)
Solution. The 4-A source and its parallel resistance of 15 Ω can be converted into a voltage
source of (15 × 4) = 60 V in series with a 15 Ω resistances as shown in Fig. 2.103 (b).
Now, we will use Superposition theorem to find current through the 10 Ω resistances.
When 60 −−−−− V Source is Removed
When 60 − V battery is removed
the total resistance as seen by 2 V bat-
tery is = 1 + 10 || (15 + 5) = 7.67 Ω.
The battery current = 2/7.67 A
= 0.26 A. At point A, this current is
divided into two parts. The current
passing through the 10 Ω resistor
from A to B is Fig. 2.103
I = 0.26 × (20/30) = 0.17 A
1
When 2-V Battery is Removed
Then resistance seen by 60 V battery is = 20 + 10 || 1 = 20.9 Ω. Hence, battery current = 60/20.9
= 2.87 A. This current divides at point A. The current flowing through 10 Ω resistor from A to B is
I = 2.87 × 1/(1 + 10) = 0.26 A
2
Total current through 10 Ω resistor due to two batteries acting together is = I + I = 0.43 A.
1 2
Power delivered to the 10 Ω resistor = 0.432 × 10 = 1.85 W.
Example 2.52. Compute the power dissipated in the 9-W resistor of Fig. 2.104 by applying the
Superposition principle. The voltage and current sources should be treated as ideal sources. All
resistances are in ohms.
Solution. As explained earlier, an ideal constant-voltage sources has zero internal resistances
whereas a constant-current source has an infinite internal resistance.
(i) When Voltage Source Acts Alone
This case is shown is in Fig. 2.104 (b) where constant-current source has been replaced by an
open-circuit i.e. infinite resistance (Art. 2.16). Further circuit simplification leads to the fact that total
resistances offered to voltage source is = 4 + (12 || 15) = 32/3 Ω as shown in FIg. 2.104 (c).DC Network Theorems 105
Hence current = 32 ÷ 32/3 = 3 A. At point A in Fig. 2.104 (d), this current divides into two parts.
The part going alone AB is the one that also passes through 9 Ω resistor.
I′ = 3 × 12/(15 + 12) = 4/3 A
Fig. 2.104
(ii) When Current Source Acts Alone
As shown in Fig. 2.105 (a), the voltage source has been replaced by a short-circuit (Art 2.13).
Further simplification gives the circuit of Fig. 2.105 (b).
Fig. 2.105
The 4 - A current divides into two equal parts at point A in Fig. 2.105 (b). Hence I = 4/2 = 2 A.
Since both I′ and I′ ′ flow in the same direction, total current through 9-Ω resistor is
I = I′ + I′ ′ = (4/3) + 2 = (10/3) A
Power dissipated in 9 Ω resistor = I2 R = (10/3)2 × 9 = 100 W
Example 2.53(a). With the help of superposition theorem, obtain the value of current I and
voltage V in the circuit of Fig. 2.106 (a).
0
Solution. We will solve this question in three steps. First, we will find the value of I and V when
0
current source is removed and secondly, when voltage source is removed. Thirdly, we would com-
bine the two values of I and V in order to get their values when both sources are present.
0106 Electrical Technology
First Step
As shown in Fig. 2.106 (b), current source has been replaced by an open-circuit. Let the values
of current and voltage due to 10 V source be I and V . As seen I = 0 and V = 10 V.
1 01 1 01
Second Step
As shown in Fig. 2.106 (c), the voltage source has been replaced by a short circuit. Here
I = − 5 A and V = 5 × 10 = 50 V.
2 02
Fig. 2.106
Third Step
By applying superposition theorem, we have
I = I + I = 0 + (− 5) = −−−−− 5 A
1 2
V = V + V = 10 + 50 = 60 V
0 01 02
Example 2.53(b). Using Superposition theo-
rem, find the value of the output voltage V in the
0
circuit of Fig. 2.107.
Solution. As usual, we will break down the
problem into three parts involving one source each.
(a) When 4 A and 6 V sources are killed*
As shown in Fig. 2.108 (a), 4 A source has
been replaced by an open circuit and 6 V source by
a short-circuit. Using the current-divider rule, we
find current i through the 2 Ω resistor = 6 × 1/(1 +
1
2 + 3) = 1 A ∴ V = 1 × 2 = 2 V.
01
(b) When 6 A and 6 V sources are killed
Fig. 2.107
As shown in Fig. 2.108 (b), 6 A sources has
been replaced by an open-circuit and 6 V source by a short-circuit. The current i can again be found
2
with the help of current-divider rule because there are two parallel paths across the current source.
One has a resistance of 3 Ω and the other of (2 + 1) = 3 Ω. It means that current divides equally at
point A.
Hence, i = 4/2 = 2 A ∴ V = 2 × 2 = 4 V
2 02
(c) When 6 A and 4 A sources are killed
As shown in Fig. 2.108 (c), drop over 2 Ω resistor = 6 × 2/6 = 2 V. The potential of point B with
respect to point A is = 6 − 2 = + 4 V. Hence , V = − 4 V.
03
* The process of setting of voltage source of zero is called killing the sources.DC Network Theorems 107
According to Superposition theorem, we have
V = V + V + V = 2 + 4 − 4 = 2 V
0 01 02 03
Fig. 2.108
Example 2.54. Use Superposition theorem, to find the voltage V in Fig. 2.109 (a).
Fig. 2.109
Solution. The given circuit has been redrawn in Fig. 2.109 (b) with 15 - V battery acting alone
while the other two sources have been killed. The 12 - V battery has been replaced by a short-circuit
and the current source has been replaced by an open-circuit (O.C) (Art. 2.19). Since the output
terminals are open, no current flows through the 4 Ω resistor and hence, there is no voltage drop
across it. Obviously V equals the voltage drop over 10 Ω resistor which can be found by using the
1
voltage-divider rule.
V = 15 × 10/(40 + 10) = 3 V
1
Fig. 2.110 (a) shows the circuit when current source acts alone, while two batteries have been
killed. Again, there is no current through 4 Ω resistor. The two resistors of values 10 Ω and 40 Ω are
Fig. 2.110
in parallel across the current source. Their combined resistances is 10 || 40 = 8 Ω
∴ V = 8 × 2.5 = 20 V with point A positive.
2108 Electrical Technology
Fig. 2.110 (b) shows the case when 12 −V battery acts alone. Here, V = − 12 V*. Minus sign has
3
been taken because negative terminal of the battery is connected to point A and the positive terminal
to point B. As per the Superposition theorem,
V = V + V + V = 3 + 20 − 12 = 11 V
1 2 3
Example 2.55. Apply Superposition theorem to the circuit of Fig. 2.107 (a) for finding the
voltage drop V across the 5 Ω resistor.
Solution. Fig. 2.111 (b) shows the redrawn circuit with the voltage source acting alone while the
two current sources have been ‘killed’ i.e. have been replaced by open circuits. Using voltage-
divider principle, we get
V = 60 × 5/(5 + 2 + 3) = 30 V. It would be taken as positive, because current through the 5 Ω
1
resistances flows from A to B, thereby making the upper end of the resistor positive and the lower end
negative.
Fig. 2.111
Fig. 2.112 (a) shows the same circuit with the 6 A source acting alone while the two other sources
have been ‘killed’. It will be seen that 6 A source has to parallel circuits across it, one having a
resistance of 2 Ω and the other (3 + 5) = 8 Ω. Using the current-divider rule, the current through the
5 Ω resistor = 6 × 2/(2 + 3 + 5) = 1.2 A.
Fig. 2.112
* Because Fig. 2.110 (b) resembles a voltage source with an internal resistance = 4 + 10 || 40 = 12 Ω and
which is an open-circuit.DC Network Theorems 109
∴ V = 1.2 × 5 = 6 V. It would be taken negative because current is flowing from B to A. i.e.
2
point B is at a higher potential as compared to point A. Hence, V = − 6 V.
2
Fig. 2.112 (b) shows the case when 2-A source acts alone, while the other two sources are dead.
As seen, this current divides equally at point B, because the two parallel paths have equal resistances
of 5 Ω each. Hence, V = 5 × 1 = 5 V. It would also be taken as negative because current flows from
3
B to A. Hence, V = − 5 V.

Using Superposition principle, we get
V = V + V + V = 30 − 6 − 5 = 19 V

Step III. Apply superposition theorem, for finding the total current into the 4-ohm reistor

Check. In the branch AD,
The voltage source drives a current from A to D of 2.059 amp, and the current source drives a
current of I (= 2I ) which is 0.588 amp, from D to A.
d c
The net current in branch AD

With respect to O, A is at a potential of + 10 volts.
Potential of D with respect to O

Between A and D, the potential difference is (10 − 7.06) volts
Hence, the current through this branch

This is the same as eqn. (a) and hence checks the result, obtained previously.
Example 2.57. Find the current flowing in the branch XY of the circuit shown in Fig. 2.114 (a)
by superposition theorem. [Nagpur University, April 1996]
Solution. As shown in Fig. 2.114 (b), one source is de-activated. Through series-parallel combina-
tions of resistances, the currents due to this source are calculated. They are marked as on Fig. 2.114 (b).

In the next step, second source is de-activated as in Fig. 2.114 (c). Through simple series parallel
resistances combinations, the currents due to this source are marked on the same figure.
According to the superposition theorem, the currents due to both the sources are obtained after
adding the individual contributions due to the two sources, with the final results marked on Fig. 2.114
(a). Thus, the current through the branch XY is 1.33 A from Y to X.
Example 2.58. Find the currents in all the resistors by Superposition theorem in the circuit
shown in Fig. 2.115 (a). Calculate the power consumed. [Nagpur University, Nov. 1996]
Solution. According to Superposition theorem, one source should be retained at a time,
deactivating remaining sources. Contributions due to individual sources are finally algebraically
added to get the answers required. Fig. 2.115 (b) shows only one source retained and the resultant
currents in all branches/elements. In Fig. 2.115 (c), other source is shown to be in action, with
concerned currents in all the elements marked.
To get the total current in any element, two component-currents in Fig. 2.115 (b) and Fig. 2.115
(c) for the element are to be algebraically added. The total currents are marked on Fig. 2.115 (a).

It provides a mathematical technique for replacing a given network, as viewed from two output
terminals, by a single voltage source with a series resistance. It makes the solution of complicated
networks (particularly, electronic networks) quite quick and easy. The application of this extremely
useful theorem will be explained with the help of the following simple example.

Suppose, it is required to find current flowing through load resistance

3. Now, imagine the battery to be removed from the circuit, leaving its internal resistance r
behind and redraw the circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.127 (c). When viewed inwards from
terminals A and B, the circuit consists of two parallel paths : one containing R and the other

Consequently, as viewed from terminals A and

to a single source (called Thevenin’s source) whose

It is clear from above that any network of resistors and
voltage sources (and current sources as well) when viewed from any points A and B in the network,
can be replaced by a single voltage source and a single resistance** in series with the voltage source.
After this replacement of the network by a single voltage source with a series resistance has been
accomplished, it is easy to find current in any load resistance joined across terminals A and B. This
theorem is valid even for those linear networks which have a nonlinear load.
Hence, Thevenin’s theorem, as applied to d.c. circuits, may be stated as under :
The current flowing through a load resistance R connected across any two terminals A and
L
B of a linear, active bilateral network is given by V || (R + R ) where V is the open-circuit

Example 2.59. Convert the circuit shown in Fig. 2.129 (a), to a single voltage source in series

Solution. Obviously, we have
to find equivalent Thevenin circuit.
For this purpose, we have to cal-
culate (i) V or V and (ii) R or
th AB th
R .
AB
With terminals A and B open,
the two voltage sources are
connected in subtractive series
because they oppose each other.
Net voltage around the circuit is
(15 − 10) = 5 V and total resistance
is (8 + 4) = 12 Ω. Hence circuit
current is = 5/12 A. Drop across 4
Ω resistor = 4 × 5/12 = 5/3 V with Fig. 2.129
the polarity as shown in Fig. 2.129 (a).
∴ V = V = + 10 + 5/3 = 35/3 V.

Incidently, we could also find V while going along the parallel route BFEA.
AB
Drop across 8 Ω resistor = 8 × 5/12 = 10/3 V. V equal the algebraic sum of voltages met on the
AB
way from B to A. Hence, V = (− 10/3) + 15 = 35/3 V.
AB
As shown in Fig. 2.129 (b), the single voltage source has a voltage of 35/3 V.
For finding R , we will replace the two voltage sources by short-circuits. In that case, R = R

current through the 4 Ω resistor of the circuit of Fig. 2.130 (a).
(A.M.I.E. Sec. B Network Analysis W.)
Solution. As shown in Fig. 2.130 (b), 4 Ω resistance has been removed thereby open-circuiting
the terminals A and B. We will now find V and R which will give us V and R respectively. The
AB AB th th
potential drop across 5 Ω resistor can be found with the help of voltage-divider rule. Its value is

Fig. 2.130
For finding V , we will go from point B to point A in the clock-
AB
wise direction and find the algebraic sum of the voltages met on the
way.
∴ V = − 6 + 5 = − 1 V.
AB
It means that point A is negative with respect to point E, or point
B is at a higher potential than point A by one volt.
In Fig. 2.130 (c), the two voltage source have been short-
circuited. The resistance of the network as viewed from points A and
B is the same as viewed from points A and C.
∴ R = R = 5 || 10 = 10/3 Ω

Thevenin’s equivalent source is shown in Fig. 2.131 in which 4

Example 2.61. With reference to the network of Fig. 2.132 (a), by applying Thevenin’s theorem
find the following :
(i) the equivalent e.m.f. of the network when viewed from terminals A and B.
(ii) the equivalent resistance of the network when looked into from terminals A and B.
(iii) current in the load resistance R of 15 Ω. (Basic Circuit Analysis, Nagpur Univ. 1993)
L
Solution. (i) Current in the network before load resistance is connected [Fig. 2.132 (a)]
= 24/(12 + 3 + 1) = 1.5 A
∴ voltage across terminals AB = V = V = 12 × 1.5 = 18 V
oc th
Hence, so far as terminals A and B are concerned, the network has an e.m.f. of 18 volt (and not
24 V).
(ii) There are two parallel paths between points A and B. Imagine that battery of 24 V is removed
but not its internal resistance. Then, resistance of the circuit as looked into from point A and B is

Solution. (i) Finding V

If we remove the 4-Ω resistor, the circuit becomes as shown in Fig. 2.133 (b). Since full 10 A
current passes through 2 Ω resistor, drop across it is 10 × 2 = 20 V. Hence, V = 20 V with respect to
B
the common ground. The two resistors of 3 Ω and 6 Ω are connected in series across the 12 V battery.
Hence, drop across 6 Ω resistor = 12 × 6/(3 + 6) = 8 V.
∴ V = 8 V with respect to the common ground*

∴ V = V = V − V = 20 − 8 = 12 V—with B at a higher potential

Now, we will find R i.e. equivalent resistance of the
th
network as looked back into the open-circuited terminals A and
B. For this purpose, we will replace both the voltage and current
sources. Since voltage source has no internal resistance, it would
be replaced by a short circuit i.e. zero resistance. However,
current source would be removed and replaced by an ‘open’
i.e. infinite resistance (Art. 1.18). In that case, the circuit
becomes as shown in Fig. 2.133 (c). As seen from Fig. 2.133
(d), F = 6 || 3 + 2 = 4 Ω. Hence, Thevenin’s equivalent circuit

Solution. When the 10 Ω resistance is removed, the circuit becomes as shown in Fig. 2.135 (b).

Now, we will find the open-circuit voltage V = V . For this purpose, we will go from point B

to point A and find the algebraic sum of the voltages met on the way.
It should be noted that with terminals A and B open, there is no volt-
age drop on the 8 Ω resistance. However the two resistances of 5 Ω
and 2 Ω are connected in series across the 20-V battery. As per volt-
age-divider rule, drop on 2 Ω resistance = 20 × 2/(2 + 5) = 5.71 V

Hence, the equivalent Thevenin’s source with respect to terminals A and B is as shown in Fig.
2.136. When 10 Ω resistance is reconnected across A and B, current through it is I = 6.24/(9.43 + 10)

First step is to remove 7 Ω resistor thereby open-circuiting terminals A and B as shown in Fig.
2.137 (b). Obviously, there is no current through the 1 Ω resistor and hence no drop across it.
Therefore V = V = V . As seen, current I flows due to the combined action of the two batteries.

As shown in Fig. 2.137 (c), the two batteries have been replaced by short-circuits (SC) since their

i th
as shown in Fig. 2.137 (d) where the 7 Ω resistance has been reconnected across terminals A and B.

The p.d. across this resistor can be found with the help of Voltage Divider Rule (Art. 1.15).

Example 2.65. Use Thevenin’s theorem to find the current in a resistance load connected between
the terminals A and B of the network shown in Fig. 2.138 (a) if the load is (a) 2 Ω (b) 1 Ω.
(Elect. Technology, Gwalior Univ.)
Solution. For finding open-circuit voltage V or V across terminals A and B, we must first find
oc th
current I flowing through branch CD. Using Maxwell’s loop current method (Art. 2.11), we have
2
from Fig. 2.131 (a).
− 2 I − 4 (I − I ) + 8 = 0 or 3 I − 2 I = 4

Also − 2 I − 2 I − 4 − 4 (I − I ) = 0 or I − 2 I = 1
2 2 2 1 1 2
From these two equations, we get I = 0.25 A
2
As we go from point D to C, voltage rise = 4 + 2 × 0.25 = 4.5 V
Hence, V = 4.5 or V = V = 4.5 V. Also, it may be noted that point A is positive with respect
CD AB th
to point B.

In Fig. 2.138 (b), both batteries have been removed. By applying laws of series and parallel
combination of resistances, we get R = R = 5/4 Ω = 1.25 Ω.

Note. We could also find V and R by first Thevenining part of the circuit across terminals E and F and
oc i
then across A and B (Ex. 2.62).
Example 2.66. The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge have the following resistances :
AB = 100, BC = 10, CD = 4, DA = 50 Ω. A galvanometer of 20 Ω resistance is connected across
BD. Use Thevenin’s theorem to compute the current through the galvanometer when a p.d. of 10 V
is maintained across AC. (Elect. Technology, Vikram Univ. of Ujjain)120 Electrical Technology
Solution. (i) When galvanometer is removed from Fig. 2.139 (a), we get the circuit of
Fig. 2.139 (b).
(ii) Let us next find the open-circuit voltage V (also called Thevenin voltage V ) between
oc th
points B and D. Remembering that ABC (as well as ADC) is a potential divider on which a voltage
drop of 10 V takes place, we get
Potential of B w.r.t. C = 10 × 10/110 = 10/11 = 0.909 V
Potential of D w.r.t. C = 10 × 4/54 = 20/27 = 0.741 V
∴ p.d. between B and D is V or V = 0.909 − 0.741 = 0.168 V
oc th
(iii) Now, remove the 10-V battery retaining its internal resistance which, in this case, happens to
be zero. Hence, it amounts to short-circuiting points A and C as shown in Fig. 2.139 (d).
Fig. 2.139
(iv) Next, let us find the resistance of the whole network as viewed from points B and D. It may
be easily found by noting that electrically speaking, points A and C have become one as shown in
Fig. 2.140 (a). It is also seen that BA is in parallel with BC and AD is in parallel with CD. Hence,
R = 10 || 100 + 50 || 4 = 12.79 Ω.

and internal resistance R = 12.79 Ω. This Thevenin’s source is shown in Fig. 2.140 (c).

(vi) Finally, let us connect the galvanometer (initially removed) to this Thevenin source and
calculate the current I flowing through it. As seen from Fig. 2.140 (d).

For finding R i.e. the circuit resistance as viewed from terminals A and B, the battery has been short-

Now, as we go from B to A via point E,
there is a rise in voltage of 8 V followed by
another rise in voltage of 24 V thereby
giving a total voltage drop of 32 V. Hence
V = 32 V with point A positive.

Solution. When 6 Ω resistor is removed [Fig. 2.149 (b)], whole of 2 A current flows along

For finding R or R 18 V voltage source is replaced by a short-circuit (Art- 2.15) and the current

equivalent to an 8 Ω resistance. However, this 8 Ω resistor is in parallel with a short of 0 Ω.
Hence, their equivalent value is 0 Ω. Now this 0Ω resistance is in series with the 2 Ω resistor.
Hence, R = 2 + 0 = 2 Ω. The Thevenin’s equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 2.149 (d).

∴ I = 8/(2 + 6) = 1 Amp —from A to B
Example 2.73. Find Thevenin’s equivalent circuit for the network shown in Fig. 2.150 (a)
for the terminal pair AB.
Solution. It should be carefully noted that after coming to point D, the 6 A current has only one
path to reach its other end C i.e., through 4 Ω resistor thereby creating and IR drop of 6 × 4 = 24 V
with polarity as shown in Fig. 2.150 (b). No part of it can go along DE or DF because it would not
find any path back to point C. Similarly, current due to 18-V battery is restricted to loop EDFE.
Drop across 6 Ω resistor = 18 × 6/(6 + 3) = 12 V. For finding V , let us start from A and go to B via

Hence, Thevenin’s equivalent circuit for terminals A and B is as shown in
Fig. 2.151. It should be noted that if a load resistor is connected across AB,
Fig. 2.151
current through it will flow from B to A.

rent sources. Calculate (a) V and (b) R between the open terminals A and B of the circuit. All
th th
resistance values are in ohms.
Solution. It should be understood that since terminals A and B are open, 2 A current can flow
only through 4 Ω and 10 Ω resistors, thus producing a drop of 20 V across the 10 Ω resistor, as shown
in Fig. 2.152 (b). Similarly, 3 A current can flow through its own closed circuit between A and C
thereby producing a drop of 24 V across 8 Ω resistor as shown in Fig. 2.152 (b). Also, there is no
drop across 2 Ω resistor because no current flows through it.

current source of 4 A, with a parallel resistance of 12 Ω, as shown in Fig. 2.154 (b).
In Fig. 2.154 (c), the two parallel resistance of 12 Ω each have been combined into a single
resistance of 6 Ω. It is obvious that 4 A current flows through the 6 Ω resistor, thereby producing a
drop of 6 × 4 = 24 V. Hence, V = V = 24 V with terminal A negative. In other words V = − 24V.

Solution. It is seen from Fig. 2.155 (a) that positive end of the 24 V source has been shown
connected to point A. It is understood that the negative terminal is connected to the ground terminalG.
Just to make this point clear, the given circuit has been redrawn in Fig. 2.155 (b) as well as in
Fig. 2.155 (c).
Let us start from the positive terminal of the battery and go to its negative terminal G via point C.
We find that between points C and G, there are two parallel paths : one of 6 Ω resistance and the
Fig. 2.155
other of (2 + 4) = 6 Ω resistance, giving a combined resistance of 6 || 6 = 3 Ω. Hence, total resistance
between positive and negative terminals of the battery = 3 + 3 = 6 Ω. Hence, battery current = 24/6
= 4 A. As shown in Fig. 2.155 (c), this current divides equally at point C. Let us go from B to A via
points D and G and total up the potential difference between the two, V = V = − 8 V + 24 V = 16V

For finding R , let us replace the voltage source by a short-circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.156 (a). It

2.20. General Instructions for Finding Thevenin Equivalent Circuit
So far, we have considered circuits which consisted of resistors and independent current or voltage
sources only. However, we often come across circuits which contain both independent and dependent
sources or circuits which contain only dependent sources. Procedure for finding the value of V and
th
R in such cases is detailed below :
th
(a) When Circuit Contains Both Dependent and Independent Sources
(i) The open-circuit voltage V is determined as usual with the sources activated or ‘alive’.
oc
(ii) A short-circuit is applied across the terminals a and b and the value of short-circuit
current i is found as usual.
th
(iii) Thevenin resistance R = v /i . It is the same procedure as adopted for Norton’s theo-

The above procedure is illustrated by solved examples.
Example 2.81. Find Thevenin equivalent circuit for the network shown in Fig. 2.162 (a) which
contains a current controlled voltage source (CCVS).
Fig. 2.162
Solution. For finding V available across open-circuit terminals a and b, we will apply KVL to
oc
the closed loop.
∴ 12 − 4 i × 2 i − 4 i = 0 ∴ i = 2 A
Hence, V = drop across 4 Ω resistor = 4 × 2 = 8 V. It is so because there is no current through
oc
the 2 Ω resistor.
For finding R , we will put a short-circuit across terminals a and b and calculate I , as shown in
th sh
Fig. 2.162 (b). Using the two mesh currents, we have
12 − 4 i + 2 i − 4(i − i ) = 0 and − 8 i − 4 (i − i ) = 0. Substituting i = (i − i ) and Simplifying
1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2
the above equations, we have
12 − 4 i + 2 (i − i ) − 4 (i − i ) = 0 or 3 i − i = 6 ...(i)

Solution. It will be seen that with terminals a and b open, current through the 8 Ω resistor is
v /4 and potential of point A is the same that of point a (because there is no current through 4 Ω

For finding short-circuit current i , we short-circuit the terminals a and b as shown in Fig. 2.163

(b). Since with a and b short-circuited, v = 0, the dependent current source also becomes zero.

Hence, it is replaced by an open-circuit as shown. Going around the closed loop, we get
12 − i (8 + 4) = 0 or i = 6/12 = 0.5 A

Hence, the Thevenin equivalent is as shown in Fig. 2.163 (c).
Example 2.83. Find the Thevenin equivalent circuit for the network shown in Fig. 2.164 (a)
which contains only a dependent source.
Solution. Since circuit contains no independent source, i = 0 when terminals a and b are open.
Hence, v = 0. Moreover, i is zero since v = 0.

It can be stated in the following manner :
In any linear bilateral network, if a source of e.m.f. E in any branch produces a current I in
any other branch, then the same e.m.f. E acting in the second branch would produce the same
current I in the first branch.
In other words, it simply means that E and I are mutually transferrable. The ratio E/I is known as
the transfer resistance (or impedance in a.c. systems). Another way of stating the above is that the
receiving point and the sending point in a network are interchangebale. It also means that interchange
of an ideal voltage sources and an ideal ammeter in any network will not change the ammeter reading.
Same is the case with the interchange of an ideal current source and an ideal voltmeter.
* We could also connect a source of 1 A as done in Ex. 2.83.DC Network Theorems 133
Example 2.86. In the netwrok of Fig. 2.167 (a), find (a) ammeter current when battery is at A
and ammeter at B and (b) when battery is at B and ammeter at point A. Values of various resistances
are as shown in diagram. Also, calculate the transfer resistance.
Solution. (a) Equivalent resistance between points C and B in Fig. 2.167 (a) is
= 12 × 4/16 = 3 Ω
∴ Total circuit reistance
= 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 Ω
∴ Battery current = 36/9 = 4 A
∴ Ammeter current
= 4 × 12/16 = 3 A.
(b) Equivalent resistance between points C
and D in Fig. 2.167 (b) is
= 12 × 6/18 = 4 Ω
Total circuit resistance= 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 Ω Fig. 2.167
Battery current = 36/8 = 4.5 A
∴ Ammeter current = 4.5 × 12/18 = 3 A
Hence, ammeter current in both cases is the same.
Transfer resistance = 36/3 = 12 ΩΩΩΩΩ.
Example 2.87. Calculate the currents in the various branches of the network shown in Fig.
2.168 and then utilize the principle of Superposition and Reciprocity theorem together to find the
value of the current in the 1-volt battery circuit when an e.m.f. of 2 votls is added in branch BD
opposing the flow of original current in that branch.
Solution. Let the currents in the various branches be as shown in the figure. Applying Kirchhoff’s
second law, we have
For loop ABDA ; − 2I − 8I + 6I = 0 or I − 3I + 4I = 0 ...(i)
1 3 2 1 2 3
For loop BCDB, − 4 (I − I ) + 5 (I + I ) + 8I = 0 or 4I − 5I − 17I = 0 ...(ii)
1 3 2 3 3 1 2 3
For loop ABCEA, − 2I − 4(I − I ) − 10(I + I ) + 1 = 0 or 16I + 10I − 4I = 1 ...(iii)
1 1 3 1 2 1 2 3
Solving for I , I and I , we get I = 0.494 A; I = 0.0229 A; I = 0.0049 A
1 2 3 1 2 3
Fig. 2.168 Fig. 2.169
∴ Current in the 1 volt battery circuit is I + I = 0.0723 A.
1 2
The new circuit having 2 - V battery connected in the branch BD is shown in Fig. 2.169. According
to the Principle of Superposition, the new current in the 1- volt battery circuit is due to the superposition
of two currents; one due to 1 - volt battery and the other due to the 2 - volt battery when each acts
independently.
The current in the external circuit due to 1 - volt battery when 2 - volt battery is not there, as
found above, is 0.0723 A.134 Electrical Technology
Now, according to Reciprocity theorem; if 1 - volt battery were tansferred to the branch BD
(where it produced a current of 0.0049 A), then it would produce a current of 0.0049 A in the branch
CEA (where it was before). Hence, a battery of 2 - V would produce a current of (− 2 × 0.0049) = −
0.0098 A (by proportion). The negative sign is used because the 2 - volt battery has been so con-
nected as to oppose the current in branch BD,
∴ new current in branch CEA = 0.0723 − 0.0098 = 0.0625 A

2.22. Delta/Star* Transformation
In solving networks (having considerable number of branches) by the application of Kirchhoff’s
Laws, one sometimes experiences great difficulty due to a large number of simultaneous equations
that have to be solved. However, such complicated network can be simplified by successively replacing
delta meshes by equivalent star system and vice versa.
Suppose we are given three resistances R , R and R connected in delta fashion between
12 23 31
terminals 1, 2 and 3 as in Fig. 2.185 (a). So far as the respective terminals are concerned, these three
given resistances can be replaced by the three resistances R , R and R connected in star as shown in
1 2 3
Fig. 2.185 (b).
These two arrangements will be electrically equivalent if the resistance as measured between any
pair of terminals is the same in both the arrangements. Let us find this condition.
Fig. 2.185
First, take delta connection : Between terminals 1 and 2, there are two parallel paths; one having
a resistance of R and the other having a resistance of (R + R ).
12 12 31
R ×(R +R )
∴ Resistance between terminals 1 and 2 is = 12 23 31
R +(R +R )
12 23 31
Now, take star connection : The resistance between the same terminals 1 and 2 is (R + R ).
1 2
As terminal resistances have to be the same
R ×(R +R )
∴ R + R = 12 23 31 ...(i)
1 2 R +R +R
12 23 31
Similarly, for terminals 2 and 3 and terminals 3 and 1, we get
R ×(R +R )
R + R = 23 31 12 ...(ii)
2 3 R +R +R
12 23 31
R ×(R +R )
and R + R = 31 12 23 ...(iii)
3 1 R +R +R
12 23 31
Now, subtracting (ii) from (i) and adding the result to (iii), we get
R R R R R R
R = 12 31 ;R = 23 12 and R = 31 23
1 R +R + R 2 R +R + R 3 R + R + R
12 23 31 12 23 31 12 23 31
* In Electronics, star and delta circuits are generally referred to as T and π circuits respectively.138 Electrical Technology
How to Remember ?
It is seen from above that each numerator is the product of the two sides of the delta which meet
at the point in star. Hence, it should be remembered that : resistance of each arm of the star is given
by the product of the resistances of the two delta sides that meet at its end divided by the sum of the
three delta resistances.
2.23.Star/Delta Transformation
This tarnsformation can be easily done by using equations (i), (ii) and (iii) given above. Multi-
plying (i) and (ii), (ii) and (iii), (iii) and (i) and adding them together and then simplifying them, we
get

How to Remember ?
The equivalent delta resistance between any two terminals is given by the sum of star resistances
between those terminals plus the product of these two star resistances divide by the third star
resistances.
Example 2.88. Find the input resistance of the circuit between the points A and B of Fig 2.186(a).
(AMIE Sec. B Network Analysis Summer 1992)
Solution. For finding R , we will convert the delta CDE of Fig. 2.186 (a) into its equivalent star
AB
as shown in Fig. 2.186 (b).
R = 8 × 4/18 = 16/9 Ω; R , = 8 × 6/18 = 24/9 Ω; R = 6 × 4/18 = 12/9 Ω.
CS ES DS
The two parallel resistances between S and B can be reduced to a single resistance of 35/9 Ω.

As seen from Fig. 2.186 (c), R = 4 + (16/9) + (35/9) = 87/9 Ω.

Example 2.89. Calculate the equivalent resistance between the terminals A and B in the net-
work shown in Fig. 2.187 (a). (F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. The given circuit can be redrawn as shown in Fig. 2.187 (b). When the delta BCD is
converted to its equivalent star, the circuit becomes as shown in Fig. 2.187 (c).
Each arm of the delta has a resistance of 10 Ω. Hence, each arm of the equivalent star has a
resistance = 10 × 10/30 = 10/3 Ω. As seen, there are two parallel paths between points A and N, each
having a resistance of (10 + 10/3) = 40/3 Ω. Their combined resistance is 20/3 Ω. Hence,
R = (20/3) + 10/3 = 10 Ω.

Example 2.90. Calculate the current flowing through the 10 Ω resistor of Fig. 2.188 (a) by
using any method. (Network Theory, Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. It will be seen that there are two deltas in the circuit i.e. ABC and DEF. They have
been converted into their equivalent stars as shown in Fig. 2.188 (b). Each arm of the delta ABC has
a resistance of 12 Ω and each arm of the equivalent star has a resistance of 4 Ω. Similarly, each arm
of the delta DEF has a resistance of 30 Ω and the equivalent star has a resistance of 10 Ω per arm.
The total circuit resistance between A and F = 4 + 48 || 24 + 10 = 30 Ω. Hence I = 180/30 = 6 A.
Current through 10 Ω resistor as given by current-divider rule = 6 × 48/(48 + 24) = 4 A.

2.24. Compensation Theorem
This theorem is particularly useful for the following two purposes :
(a) For analysing those networks where the values of the branch elements are varied and for
studying the effect of tolerance on such values.
(b) For calculating the sensitivity of bridge network.
As applied to d.c. circuits, it may be stated in the following for ways :
(i) In its simplest form, this theorem asserts that any resistance R in a branch of a network in
which a current I is flowing can be replaced, for the purposes of calculations, by a voltage
equal to – IR.
OR
(ii) If the resistance of any branch of network is changed from R to (R + ΔΔΔΔΔR) where the
current flowing originally is I, the change of current at any other place in the network
may be calculated by assuming that an e.m.f. – I. ΔΔΔΔΔR has been injected into the modified
branch while all other sources have their e.m.f.s. suppressed and are represented by their
internal resistances only.
Example 2.95. Calculate the values of new currents in the network illustrated in Fig. 2.200
when the resistor R is increased (in place of s) by 30 %.

rent distribution becomes as shown in Fig. 2.201 (b)

2.25. Norton’s Theorem
This theorem is an alternative to the Thevenin’s theorem. In fact, it is the dual of Thevenin’s
theorem. Whereas Thevenin’s theorem reduces a two-terminal active network of linear resistances
and generators to an equivalent constant-voltage source and series resistance, Norton’s theorem replaces
the network by an equivalent constant-current source and a parallel resistance.DC Network Theorems 145
This theorem may be stated as follows :
(i) Any two-terminal active network containing voltage sources and resistance when viewed
from its output terminals , is equivalent to a constant-current source and a parallel resistance.
The constant current is equal to the current which would flow in a short-circuit placed across the
terminals and parallel resistance is the resistance of the network when viewed from these open-
circuited terminals after all voltage and current sources have been removed and replaced by their
internal resistances.
Fig. 2.202
Explanation
As seen from Fig. 2.202 (a), a short is placed across the terminals A and B of the network with all
its energy sources present. The short-circuit current I gives the value of constant-current source.
SC
For finding R, all sources have been removed as shown in Fig. 2.202 (b). The resistance of the
i
network when looked into from terminals A and B gives R.
i
The Norton’s* equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 2.202 (c). It consists of an ideal constant-
current source of infinite internal resistance (Art. 2.16) having a resistance of R connected in parallel
i
with it. Solved Examples 2.96, 2.97 and 2.98 etc. illustrate this procedure.
(ii) Another useful generalized form of this theorem is as follows :
The voltage between any two points in a network is equal to I R where I is the short-
SC. i SC
circuit current between the two points and R is the resistance of the network as viewed from these
i
points with all voltage sources being replaced by their internal resistances (if any) and current
sources replaced by open-circuits.
Suppose, it is required to find the voltage across resistance R and hence current through it [Fig.
3
2.202 (d)]. If short-circuit is placed between A and B, then current in it due to battery of e.m.f. E is

2.26. How To Nortonize a Given Circuit ?
This procedure is based on the first statement of the theorem given above.
1. Remove the resistance (if any) across the two given terminals and put a short-circuit across
them.
2. Compute the short-circuit current I .
SC
3. Remove all voltage sources but retain their internal resistances, if any. Similarly, remove all
current sources and replace them by open-circuits i.e. by infinite resistance.
4. Next, find the resistance R (also called R ) of the network as looked into from the given
1 N
terminals. It is exactly the same as R (Art. 2.16).
th
5. The current source (I ) joined in parallel across R between the two terminals gives Norton’s
SC i
equivalent circuit.
As an example of the above procedure, please refer to Solved Example No. 2.87, 88, 90 and 91
given below.
Example 2.96. Determine the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits between terminals A

Hence, Thevenin equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 2.203 (b).
(b) Norton Equivalent Circuit
A short placed across terminals A and B will short out R as well. Hence, I = E/R . The Norton
2 SC 1
equivalent resistance is exactly the same as Thevenin resistance except that it is connected in parallel
with the current source as shown in Fig. 2.203 (c)
Example 2.97. Using Norton’s theorem, find the constant-current equivalent of the circuit shown
in Fig. 2.204 (a).
Solution. When terminals A and B are short-circuited as shown in Fig. 2.204 (b), total resistance
of the circuit, as seen by the battery, consists of a 10 Ω resistance in series with a parallel combination
of 10 Ω and 15 Ω resistances.
15×10
∴ total resistance = 10+ = 16 Ω
15+10
∴ battery current I =100/16 = 6.25 ADC Network Theorems 147
Fig. 2.204
This current is divided into two parts at point C of Fig. 2.204 (b).
Current through A B is I = 6.25 × 10/25 = 2.5 A
SC
Since the battery has no internal resistance, the input resistance of the network when viewed
from A and B consists of a 15 Ω resistance in series with the parallel combination of 10 Ω and 10 Ω.
Hence, R = 15 + (10/2) = 20 Ω
1
Hence, the equivalent constant-current source is as shown in Fig. 2.204 (c).
Example 2.98. Apply Norton’s theorem to calculate current flowing through 5 – Ω resistor of
Fig. 2.05 (a).
Solution. (i) Remove 5 – Ω resistor and put a short across terminals A and B as shown in
Fig. 2.205 (b). As seen, 10 − Ω resistor also becomes short-circuited.
(ii) Let us now find I . The battery sees a parallel combination of 4 Ω and 8 Ω in series with a
SC
4 Ω resistance. Total resistance seen by the battery = 4 + 4 || 8 = 20/3 Ω. Hence, I = 20 + 20/3 =
3 A. This current divides at point C of Fig. 2.205 (b). Current going along path CAB gives I . Its
SC
value = 3 × 4/12 = 1 A.
Fig. 2.205
(iii) In Fig. 2.205 (c), battery has been removed leaving behind its internal resistance which, in
this case, is zero.
Resistance of the network looking into the terminals A and B in Fig. 2.205 (d) is
R = 10 || 10 = 5 Ω
i
(iv) Hence, Fig. 2.205 (e), gives the Norton’s equivalent circuit.148 Electrical Technology
(v) Now, join the 5 − Ω resistance back across terminals A and B. The current flowing through
it, obviously, is I = 1 × 5/10 = 0.5 A.

Example 2.99. Find the voltage across points A and B in the network shown in Fig. 2.206 (a) by
using Norton’s theorem.
Solution. The voltage between points A and B is V = I R

where I = short-circuit current between A and B
SC
R = Internal resistance of the network as viewed from points A and B.

When short-circuit is placed between A and B, the current flowing in it due to 50-V battery is
= 50/50 = 1 A – from A to B
Current due to 100 V battery is = 100/20 = 5 A – from B to A
I = 1 − 5 = − 4 A – from B to A
SC
Fig. 2.206 (a) Fig. 2.206 (b)
Now, suppose that the two batteries are removed so that the circuit becomes as shown in Fig.
2.206 (b). The resistance of the network as viewed from points A and B consists of three resistances
of 10 Ω, 20 Ω and 50 Ω ohm connected in parallel (as per second statement of Norton’s theorem).
∴ 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 ; hence R = 100 Ω

∴ V = − 4 × 100/17 = −−−−− 23.5 V

The negative sign merely indicates that point B is at a higher potential with respect to the point A.

resistor in the circuit of Fig. 2.207 (a). All resistance values are in ohm.
Solution. (a) Short-Circuit Current I

As shown in Fig. 2.207 (b), terminals A and B have been shorted after removing 15 Ω resistor.
We will use Superposition theorem to find I .

(i) When Only Current Source is Present
In this case, 30-V battery is replaced by a short-circuit. The 4 A current divides at point D
between parallel combination of 4 Ω and 6 Ω. Current through 6 Ω resistor is
I ′ = 4 × 4/(4 + 6) = 1.6 A – from B to A
SC
(ii) When Only Battery is Present
In this case, current source is replaced by an open-circuit so that no current flows in the branch
CD. The current supplied by the battery constitutes the short-circuit current
∴ I ″ = 30/(4 + 6) = 3 A – from A to B

∴ I = I ″ − I ′ = 3 − 1.6 = 1.4 A – from A to B

As seen from Fig. 2.207 (c) R = 4 + 6 = 10 Ω. The 8 Ω resistance does not come into the picture

because of an open in the branch CD.
Fig. 2.207 (d) shows the Norton’s equivalent circuit along with the load resistor.

Solution. In Fig. 2.208 (b), terminals A and B have been short-circuited. Current in the shorted
path due to E is = 120/40 = 3 A from A to B. Current due to E is 180/60 = 3 A from A to B. Hence

of Fig. 2.209 (a). All resistance are in ohms.150 Electrical Technology
Fig. 2.209
Solution. When the branch containing 6 − Ω resistance is short-circuited, the given circuit is
reduced to that shown in Fig. 2.209 (b) and finally to Fig. 2.209 (c). As seen, the 12 A current
divides into two unequal parts at point A. The current passing through 4 Ω resistor forms the short-
circuit current I .
SC
Resistance R between points C and D when they are open-circuited is

It is so because the constant-current source has infinite resistance i.e., it behaves like an open
circuit as shown in Fig. 2.209 (d).
Hence, Norton’s equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 2.209 (e). As seen current of 8 A is
divided equally between the two equal resistances of 6 Ω each. Hence, current through the required
6 Ω resistor is 4 A.
I = 12× 8 =8A

Example 2.103. Using Norton’s theorem, find the current which would flow in a 25 − Ω resistor
connected between points N and O in Fig. 2.210 (a). All resistance values are in ohms.
Solution. For case of understanding, the given circuit may be redrawn as shown in Fig. 2.210
(b). Total current in short-circuit across ON is equal to the sum of currents driven by different batter-
ies through their respective resistances.
I = 10 + 20 + 30 =5.5A

Solution. For solving this circuit, we will Nortonise the circuit to the left to the terminals 1 − 1′

The two equivalent Norton circuits can now be put back across terminals 1−1′ and 2−2′ , as
shown in Fig. 2.213 (a).
The two current sources, being in parallel, can be combined into a single source of 7.5 + 2.5 =
10A. The three resistors are in parallel and their equivalent resistances is 2 || 4 || 4 = 1 Ω. The value
of V as seen from Fig. 2.213 (b) is V = 10 × 1 = 10 V.

Fig. 2.214152 Electrical Technology
Solution. As explained in Art. 2.19, we will replace the 6 Ω resistance by a short-circuit as
shown in Fig. 2.214 (b). Now, we have to find the current passing through the short-circuited termi-
nals A and B. For this purpose we will use the mesh analysis by assuming mesh currents I andI .

From (i) and (ii) above, we get I = − 5/4

The negative sign shows that the actual direction of flow of I is opposite to that shown in Fig.

2.214 (b). Hence, I = I = I = − 5/4 A i.e. current flows from point B to A.

After the terminals A and B are open-circuited and the three batteries are replaced by short-
circuits (since their internal resistances are zero), the internal resistance of the circuit, as viewed from
these terminals’ is

The Norton’s equivalent circuit consists of a constant current source of 5/4 A in parallel with a
resistance of 4 Ω as shown in Fig. 2.214 (c). When 6 Ω resistance is connected across the equivalent
circuit, current through it can be found by the current-divider rule (Art).
Current through 6 Ω resistor = 5× 4 =0.5fromBto A.

2.27.General instructions For Finding Norton Equivalent Circuit
Procedure for finding Norton equivalent circuit of a given network has already been given in Art.
That procedure applies to circuits which contain resistors and independent voltage or current sources.
Similar procedures for circuits which contain both dependent and independent sources or only
dependent sources are given below :
(a) Circuits Containing Both Dependent and Independent Sources
(i) Find the open-circuit voltage v with all the sources activated or ‘alive’.

Example 2.106. Find the Norton equivalent for the transistor amplifier circuit shown is Fig.
2.215 (a). All resistances are in ohms.
Fig. 2.215DC Network Theorems 153
Solution. We have to find the values of i and R . It should be noted that when terminals a and
sh N
b are short-circuited, v = 0. Hence, in that case, we find from the left-hand portion of the circuit that
ab
i = 2/200 = 1/100A = 0.01 A. As seen from Fig. 2.215 (b), the short-circuit across terminals a and b,
short circuits 20 Ω resistance also. Hence, i = − 5 i = − 5 × 0.01 = − 0.05 A.
sh
Now, for finding R , we need v = v from the left-hand portion of the Fig. 2.215 (a). Applying

KVL to the closed circuit, we have
2 − 200 i − v = 0 ...(i)

Now, from the right-hand portion of the circuit, we find v = drop over 20 Ω resistance = − 20 ×

5i = − 100 i. The negative sign is explained by the fact that currert flows from point b towards point

∴ R = v /i = − 2/− 0.05 = 40 Ω

Hence, the Norton equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 2.215 (c).
Example 2.107. Using Norton’s theorem, compute current through the 1-Ω resistor of Fig.
2.216.
Solution. We will employ source conversion technique to simplify the given circuit. To begin
with, we will convert the three voltge sources into their equivalent current sources as shown in Fig.
2.216 (b) and (c). We can combine together the two current sources on the left of EF but cannot
combine the 2-A source across CD because of the 3-Ω resistance between C and E.
Fig. 2.216
In Fig. 2.217 (b), the two current sources at the left-hand side of 3 Ω resistor have been replaced
by a single (2 A + 1 A) = 3 A current source having a single parallel resistance 6 || 6 = 3 Ω.154 Electrical Technology
Fig. 2.217
We will now apply Norton’s theorem to the circuit on the left-hand side of CD [Fig. 2.217 (c)]
to convert it into a single current source with a single parallel resistor to replace the two 3 Ω resistors.
As shown in Fig. 2.217 (d), it yields a 1.5 A current source in parallel with a 6 Ω resistor. This current
source can now be combined with the one across CD as shown in Fig. 2.217 (e). The current through
the 1-Ω resistor is
I = 3.5 × 4/(4 + 1) = 2.8 A

If we apply KVL to the first loop of Fig. 2.218 (a), we get

From the second @ loop, we have
− 11 (x − y) + 20 + 4y = 0 or 11x − 15y = 20 ...(ii)
From (i) and (ii), we get x = 10.75 A; y = 6.56 A and (x − y) = 4.2 A.
Now, V = V i.e. voltage of point A with respect to point B. For finding its value, we start from
th AB
point B and go to point A either via 3 Ω resistance or 4 Ω resistance or (5 + 8) = 13 Ω resistance and
take the algebraic sum of the voltage met on the way. Taking the first route, we get
V = − 20 + 3 (x − y) = − 20 + 3 × 4.2 = − 7.4 V

Norton’s Equivalent Circuit
For this purpose, we will short-circuit the terminals A and B find the short-circuit currents produced
by the two voltage sources. When viewed from the side of the 80-V source, a short across AB short-
circuits everything on the right side of AB. Hence, the circuit becomes as shown in Fig. 2.230 (a).
The short-circuit current I can be found with the help of series-parallel circuit technique. The total

resistance offered to the 80 − V source is 5 + 4 || 8 = 23/3 Ω.158 Electrical Technology
∴ I = 80 × 3/23 = 10.43 A; ∴ I = 10.43 × 4/12 = 3.48 A.

When viewed from the side of the 20-V source, a short across AB short-circuits everything beyond

(b) As Applicable to Current Sources
This theorem is applicable to a mixture of parallel voltage and current sources that are reduced
to a single final equivalent source which is either a constant current or a constant voltage source. This
theorem can be stated as follows :
Any number of constant current sources which are directly connected in parallel can be converted
into a single current source whose current is the algebraic sum of the individual source currents and
whose total internal resistances equals the combined individual source resistances in parallel.
Example 2.111. Use Millman’s theorem, to find the voltage across and current through the load
resistor R in the circuit of Fig. 2.223 (a).
L
Solution. First thing to do is to convert the given voltage sources into equivalent current sources.
It should be kept in mind that the two batteries are connected in opposite direction. Using source
conversion technique given in Art. 1.14 we get the circuit of Fig. 2.223 (b).
Fig. 2.223
The algebraic sum of the currents = 5 + 3 − 4 = 4 A. The combined resistance is = 12 || 4 || 6 =
2 Ω. The simplified circuit is shown in the current–source form in Fig. 2.224 (a) or voltage source
form in Fig. 2.224 (b).
Fig. 2.224
As seen from Fig. 2.224 (c).
I = 8/(2 + 8) = 0.8 A ; V = 8 × 0.8 = 64 V
L L
Alternatively, V = 8 × 8/(2 + 8) = 6.4 V
L
Following steps are necessary when using Millman’s Theorem :
1. convert all voltage sources into their equivalent current sources.
2. calculate the algebraic sum of the individual dual source currents.160 Electrical Technology
3. if found necessary, convert the final current source into its equivalent voltage source.
As pointed out earlier, this theorem can also be applied to voltage sources which must be initially
converted into their constant current equivalents.
2.29.Generalised Form of Millman’s Theorem
This theorem is particularly useful for solving many circuits
which are frequently encountered in both electronics and power
applications.
Consider a number of admittances G , G , G ... G which
1 2 3 n
terminate at common point 0′ (Fig. 2.225). The other ends of
the admittances are numbered as 1, 2, 3....n. Let O be any other
point in the network. It should be clearly understood that it is
not necessary to know anything about the inter-connection
between point O and the end points 1, 2, 3...n. However, what is
essential to know is the voltage drops from 0 to 1, 0 to 2, ... 0 to
Fig. 2.225
n etc.
According to this theorem, the voltage drop from 0 to 0′ (V ) is given by
oo
V G +V G +V G +...+V
V ′ = 01 1 02 2 03 3 0nG n
oo G +G +G +........+G

Voltage drop across G = V ′ = (V ′ − V )

V ′ = 01 1 02 2 03 3 0n n
00 G +G +G +.............+G
1 2 3 n
Precaution
It is worth repeating that only those resis-
tances or admittances are taken into consider-
ation which terminate at the common point. All
those admittances are ignored which do not ter-
minate at the common point even though they
are connected in the circuit.
Example 2.112. Use Millman’s theorem to
calculate the voltage developed across the
40 Ω resistor in the network of Fig. 2.226. Fig. 2.226DC Network Theorems 161
Solution. Let the two ends of the 40 Ω resistor be marked as 0 and 0′ . The end points of the
three resistors terminating at the common point 0′ have been marked 1, 2 and 3. As
already explained in Art. 2.29, the two resistors of values 10 Ω and 60 Ω will not come into the
picture because they are not direclty connected to the common point 0′ .
Here,
V = − 150 V; V = 0; V = 120 V

G = 1/50 ; G = 1/40 : G = 1/20

(−150/50)+(0/40)+(120/20)
∴ V ′ = =31.6V
00 (1/50)+(1/40)+(1/20)
It shows that point 0 is at a higher potential as compared to point 0′ .
Example 2.113. Calculate the voltage across the 10 Ω
resistor in the network of Fig. 2.227 by using (a) Millman’s
theorem (b) any other method.
Solution. (a) As shown in the Fig. 2.227 we are re-
quired to calculate voltage V ′ . The four resistances are
00
connected to the common terminal 0′.
Let their other ends be marked as 1, 2, 3 and 4 as shown
in Fig. 2.227. Now potential of point 0 with respect to point
1 is (Art. 1.25) – 100 V because (see Art. 1.25) Fig. 2.227
∴ V = – 100 V; V = – 100 V ; V = 0V; V = 0V.
01 02 03 04
G = 1/100 = 0.01 Siemens ; G = 1/50 = 0.02 Siemens;

G = 1/100 = 0.01 Siemens; G = 1/10 = 0.1 Siemens

Also, V ′ = − V ′ = 21.4 V

(b) We could use the source conversion technique (Art. 2.14) to solve this question. As shown
in Fig. 2.228 (a), the two voltage sources and their series resistances have been converted into current
sources with their parallel resistances. The two current sources have been combined into a single
resistance current source of 3 A and the three parallel resistances have been combined into a single
resistance of 25 Ω. This current source has been reconverted into a voltage source of 75 V having a
series resistance of 25 Ω as shown in Fig. 2.228 (c).
Fig. 2.228
Using the voltage divider formula (Art. 1.15), the voltage drop across 10 Ω resistance is
V = 75 × 10/(10 + 25) = 21.4 V.

the voltage between A and B. (Elect. Engg. Paper-I Indian Engg. Services 1990)
Solution. The end points of the different admittances
which are connected directly to the common point B have
been marked as 1, 2 and 3 as shown in the Fig. 2.229.
Incidentally, 40 Ω resistance will not be taken into consider-
ation because it is not directly connected to the common
point B. Here V = V = −50 V ; V = V = 100 V ;

Since the answer comes out to be positive, it means that point A is at a higher potential as com-
pared to point B.
The detailed reason for not taking any notice of 40 Ω resistance are given in Art. 2.29.
2.30.Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
Although applicable to all branches of electrical engineering, this theorem is particularly useful
for analysing communication networks. The overall efficiency of a network supplying maximum
power to any branch is 50 per cent. For this reason, the application of this theorem to power transmis-
sion and distribution networks is limited because, in their case, the goal is high efficiency and not
maximum power transfer.
However, in the case of electronic and communication networks, very often, the goal is either to
receive or transmit maximum power (through at reduced efficiency) specially when power involved
is only a few milliwatts or microwatts. Frequently, the problem of maximum power transfer is of
crucial significance in the operation of transmission lines and
antennas.
As applied to d.c. networks, this theorem may be stated as
follows :
A resistive load will abstract maximum power from a
network when the load resistance is equal to the resistance of
the network as viewed from the output terminals, with all energy
sources removed leaving behind their internal resistances.
In Fig. 2.230 (a), a load resistance of R is connected across
L
the terminals A and B of a network which consists of a generator
Fig. 2.230
of e.m.f. E and internal resistance R and a series resistance R
g
which, in fact, represents the lumped resistance of the connecting
wires. Let R = R + R = internal resistance of the network as viewed from A and B.
i g
According to this theorem, R will abstract maximum power from the network when R = R.

Let us consider an a.c. source of internal impedance (R + j X ) supplying power to a load
1 1
impedance (R + jX ). It can be proved that maximum power transfer will take place when the
L L
modules of the load impedance is equal to the modulus of the source impedance i.e. | Z | = | Z |
L 1
Where there is a completely free choice about the load, the maximum power transfer is obtained
when load impedance is the complex conjugate of the source impedance. For example, if source
impedance is (R + jX ), then maximum transfer power occurs, when load impedance is (R − jX ). It
1 1 1 1
can be shown that under this condition, the load power is = E2/4R .

Example 2.115. In the network shown in Fig. 2.231 (a), find the value of R such that maximum
L
possible power will be transferred to R . Find also the value of the maximum power and the power
L

Solution. We will remove R and find the equivalent Thevenin’s source for the circuit to the left
L
of terminals A and B. As seen from Fig. 2.231 (b) V equals the drop across the vertical resistor of 3Ω
th
because no current flows through 2 Ω and 1 Ω resistors. Since 15 V drops across two series resistors
of 3 Ω each, V = 15/2 = 7/5 V. Thevenin’s resistance can be found by replacing 15 V source with a
th
short-circuit. As seen from Fig. 2.231 (b), R = 2 + (3 || 3) + 1 = 4.5 Ω. Maximum power transfer to
th
the load will take place when R = R = 4.5 Ω.

Solution. We will find Thevenin’s equivalent circuit to the left of
trminals A and B for which purpose we will convert the battery source
into a current source as shown in Fig. 2.232 (b). By combining the two
current sources, we get the circuit of Fig. 2.232 (c). It would be seen that
open circuit voltage V equals the drop over 3Ω resistance because there
AB
is no drop on the 5Ω resistance connected to terminal A. Now, there are
two parallel path across the current source each of resistance 5 Ω. Hence,
current through 3 Ω resistance equals 1.5/2 = 0.75 A. Therefore, V =

V = 3 × 0.75 = 2.25V with point A positive with respect to point B.

Example 2.117. Calculate the value of R which will absorb maximum power from the circuit of

Solution. For finding power, it is essential to know both I and R. Hence, it is essential to find an
equation relating I to R.

Let us remove R and find Thevenin’s voltage V across A and B as shown in Fig. 2.234 (b). It
th
would be helpful to convert 120 V, 10-Ω source into a constant-current source as shown in Fig. 2.234
(c). Applying KCL to the circuit, we get
V V
th + th = 12 + 6 or V = 60 V

Now, for finding R and R , the two sources are reduced to zero. Voltage of the voltage-source is
i th
reduced to zero by short - circuiting it whereas current of the current source is reduced to zero by
open-circuiting it. The circuit which results from such source suppression is shown in Fig. 2.234 (d).
Hence, R = R = 10 || 5 = 10/3 Ω. The Thevenin’s equivalent circuit of the network is shown in Fig.
i th
2.234 (e).
According to Maximum Power Transfer Theorem, R will absorb maximum power when it equals
10/3 Ω. In that case, I = 60 ÷ 20/3 = 9 A
P = I2R = 92 × 10/3 = 270 W

2.31.Power Transfer Efficiency
If P is the power supplied to the load and P is the total power supplied by the voltage source,
L T
then power transfer efficiency is given by η = P /P .
L T
Now, the generator or voltage source E supplies power to both the load resistance R and to the
L
internal resistance R = (R + R).

The variation of η with R is shown in Fig. 2.235 (a). The maximum value of η is unity when
L
R = ∞ and has a value of 0.5 when R = R. It means that under maximum power transfer conditions,
L L i
the power transfer efficiency is only 50%. As mentioned above, maximum power transfer condition
is important in communication applications but in most power systems applications, a 50% efficiency
is undesirable because of the wasted energy. Often, a compromise has to be made between the load
power and the power transfer efficiency. For example, if we make R = 2 R, then
L i
P = 0.222 E2/R and η = 0.667.
L i
It is seen that the load power is only 11% less than its maximum possible value, whereas the
power transfer efficiency has improved from 0.5 to 0.667 i.e. by 33%.

the load becomes 20 Ω. Calculate

Solution. We can find the values of E and R from the two given load conditions.

When R = 20 Ω, I = 2 A and V = IR = 2 × 20 = 40 V ∴ 40 = E − 2 R ...(ii)

theorem on the types of networks. (Circuit and Field Theory, A.M.I.E. Sec. B, 1993)

For a network consisting of n elements if i , i ,.....i are the currents flowing through the elements satisfy-

Theorem, the sum of instantaneous powers for the n branches in a network is always zero.
This theorem has wide applications. It is valid for any lumped network that contains any elements linear or
non-linear, passive or active, time-variant or time-invariant.
Explanation : This theorem will be explained with the help of the
simple circuit shown in Fig. 2.242. The total resistance seen by the battery
is = 8 + 4 || 4 = 10 Ω.
Battery current I = 100/10 = 10 A. This current divides equally at
pointB,
Drop over 8 Ω resistor = 8 × 10 = 80 V
Drop over 4 Ω resistor = 4 × 5 = 20 V
Drop over 1 Ω resistor = 1 × 5 = 5 V
Drop over 3 Ω resistor = 3 × 5 = 15 V
According to Tellegen’s Theorem, Fig. 2.242

(cid:169) Today, life without electricity is highly
unimaginable. Electric locomotives, heaters, and
fans are some of the appliances and machines
which convert electricity into work and energy176 Electrical Technology
3.1. Effect of Electric Current
It is a matter of common experience that a conductor, when carrying current, becomes hot
after some time. As explained earlier, an electric current is just a directed flow or drift of electrons
through a substance. The moving electrons as they pass through molecules of atoms of that sub-
stance, collide with other electrons. This electronic collision results in the production of heat. This
explains why passage of current is always accompanied by generation of heat.
3.2. Joule’s Law of Electric Heating
The amount of work required to maintain a current of I amperes through a resistance of R ohm
for t second is
W.D. = I2 Rt joules
= VIt joules (ä R = V/I)
= Wt joules (ä W = VI)
= V2t/R joules (ä I = V/R)
This work is converted into heat and is dissipated away. The amount
of heat produced is
H =
work done =W.D.
mechanical equivalent of heat J
where J = 4,186 joules/kcal = 4,200 joules / kcal (approx)
∴ H = I2Rt/4,200 kcal = Vlt/4,200 kcal
= Wt/4,200 kcal = V2t/4,200 R kcal
3.3. Thermal Efficiency
It is defined as the ratio of the heat actually utilized to the total heat
produced electrically. Consider the case of the electric kettle used for
boiling water. Out of the total heat produced (i) some goes to heat the
apparatus itself i.e. kettle (ii) some is lost by radiation and convection etc.
James Joule*
and (iii) the rest is utilized for heating the water. Out of these, the heat
utilized for useful purpose is that in (iii). Hence, thermal efficiency of this
electric apparatus is the ratio of the heat utilized for heating the water to the total heat produced.
Hence, the relation between heat produced electrically and heat
absorbed usefully becomes
Vlt ×η = ms (θ − θ )

Example 3.1. The heater element of an electric kettle has a con-
stant resistance of 100 Ω and the applied voltage is 250 V. Calculate
the time taken to raise the temperature of one litre of water from 15ºC
to 90ºC assuming that 85% of the power input to the kettle is usefully
employed. If the water equivalent of the kettle is 100 g, find how long
will it take to raise a second litre of water through the same tempera-
ture range immediately after the first. In an electric kettle, electric
energy is converted into heat

energy.
* James Joule was born in Salford, England, in 1818. He was a physicist who is credited with discovering the
law of conservation of energy. Joule’s name is used to describe the international unit of energy known as
the joule.Work, Power and Energy 177
Solution. Mass of water = 1000 g = 1 kg (ä 1 cm3 weight 1 gram)
Heat taken by water = 1 × (90 − 15) = 75 kcal
Heat taken by the kettle = 0.1 × (90 − 15) = 7.5 kcal
Total heat taken = 75 + 7.5 = 82.5 kcal
Heat produced electrically H = I2Rt/J kcal
Now, I = 250/100 = 2/5 A, J = 4,200 J/kcal; H = 2.52 × 100 × t/4200 kcal
Heat actually utilized for heating one litre of water and kettle
= 0.85 × 2.52 × 100 × t/4,200 kcal
0.85×6.25×100×t
∴ = 82.5 ∴ t = 10 min 52 second
4,200
In the second case, heat would be required only for heating the water because kettle would be
already hot.
0.85×6.25×100×t
∴ 75 = ∴ t = 9 min 53 second
4,200
Example 3.2. Two heater A and B are in parallel across supply voltage V. Heater A produces
500 kcal in 200 min. and B produces 1000 kcal in 10 min. The resistance of A is 10 ohm. What is the
resistance of B ? If the same heaters are connected in series across the voltage V, how much heat will
be prduced in kcal in 5 min ? (Elect. Science - II, Allahabad Univ. 1992)

Solution. Heat produced = kcal

For heater A, 500 = ...(i)

For heater B, 1000 = ...(ii)

From Eq. (i) and (ii), we get, R= 2.5 ΩΩΩΩΩ.

(c) (d)
In this a, b, and c are heaters which convert electric energy into heat; and d is the electric bulb which coverts
electric energy into light and heat178 Electrical Technology
When the two heaters are connected in series, let H be the amount of heat produced in kcal.
Since combined resistance is (10 + 2.5) = 12.5 Ω, hence
V2×(5×60)
H = ...(iii)
12.5×J
Dividing Eq. (iii) by Eq. (i), we have H = 100 kcal.
Example 3.3. An electric kettle needs six minutes to boil 2 kg of water from the initial tempera-
ture of 20ºC. The cost of electrical energy required for this operation is 12 paise, the rate being
40 paise per kWh. Find the kW-rating and the overall efficiency of the kettle.
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)
12paise
Solution. Input energy to the kettle = = 0.3 kWh
40paise/kWh
Input power = energy in kWh = 0.3 = 3 kW
Time in hours (6/60)
Hence, the power rating of the electric kettle is 3 kW
Energy utilised in heating the water
= mst = 2 × 1 × (100 − 20) = 160 kcal = 160 /860 kWh = 0.186 kWh.
Efficiency = output/input = 0.186/0.3 = 0.62 = 62%.
3.4. S.I. Units
1. Mass. It is quantity of matter contained in a body.
Unit of mass is kilogram (kg). Other multiples commonly used are :
1 quintal = 100 kg, 1 tonne = 10 quintals = 1000 kg
2. Force. Unit of force is newton (N). Its definition may be obtained from Newton’s Second
Law of Motion i.e. F = ma.
If m = 1 kg ; a = 1m/s2, then F = 1 newton.
Hence, one newton is that force which can give an acceleration of 1 m/s2 to a mass of 1 kg.
Gravitational unit of force is kilogram-weight (kg-wt). It may be defined as follows :
or
It is the force which can impart an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 to a mass of 1 kg.
It is the force which can impart an acceleration of 1 m/s2 to a mass of 9.8 kg.
Obviously, 1 kg-wt. = 9.8 N
3. Weight. It is the force with which earth pulls a body downwards. Obviously, its units are the
same as for force.
(a) Unit of weight is newton (N)
(b) Gravitational unit of weight is kg-wt.*
Note. If a body has a mass of m kg, then its weight, W = mg newtons = 9.8 newtons.
4. Work, If a force F moves a body through a distance S in its direction of application, then
Work done W = F × S
(a) Unit of work is joule (J).
If, in the above equation, F = 1 N : S = 1 m ; then work done = 1 m.N or joule.
Hence, one joule is the work done when a force of 1 N moves a body through a distance of 1 m
in the direction of its application.
(b) Gravitational unit of work is m-kg. wt or m-kg**.
* Often it is referred to as a force of 1 kg, the word ‘wt’ being omitted. To avoid confusion with mass of
1 kg, the force of 1 kg is written in engineering literature as kgf instead of kg. wt.
** Generally the work ‘wt’ is omitted and the unit is simply written as m-kg.Work, Power and Energy 179
If F = 1 kg-wt; S = 1 m; then W.D. = 1 m-kg. Wt = 1 m-kg.
Hence, one m-kg is the work done by a force of one kg-wt when applied over a distance of one
metre.
Obviously, 1 m-kg = 9.8 m-N or J.
5. Power. It is the rate of doing work. Its units is watt (W) which represents 1 joule per second.
1 W = 1 J/s
If a force of F newton moves a body with a velocity of ν m./s then
power = F × ν watt
If the velocity ν is in km/s, then
power = F × ν kilowatt
6. Kilowatt-hour (kWh) and kilocalorie (kcal)
J
1 kWh = 1000 × 1 × 3600 s = 36 × 105 J
s
1 kcal = 4,186 J ∴1 kWh = 36 × 105/4, 186 = 860 kcal
7. Miscellaneous Units
J
(i) 1 watt hour (Wh) = 1 × 3600 s = 3600 J
s
(ii) 1 horse power (metric) = 75 m-kg/s = 75 × 9.8 = 735.5 J/s or watt
(iii) 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 W and 1 megawatt (MW) = 106 W
3.5. Calculation of Kilo-watt Power of a Hydroelectric Station
Let Q = water discharge rate in cubic metres/second (m3/s), H = net water head in metre (m).
g = 9.81, η ; overall efficiency of the hydroelectric station expressed as a fraction.
Since 1 m3 of water weighs 1000 kg., discharge rate is 1000 Q kg/s.
When this amount of water falls through a height of H metre, then energy or work available per
second or available power is
= 1000 QgH J/s or W = QgH kW
Since the overall station efficiency is η, power actually available is = 9.81 η QH kW.
Example 3.4. A de-icing equipment fitted to a radio aerial consists of a length of a resistance
wire so arranged that when a current is passed through it, parts of the aerial become warm. The
resistance wire dissipates 1250 W when 50 V is maintained across its ends. It is connected to a d.c.
supply by 100 metres of this copper wire, each conductor of which has resistance of 0.006 Ω/m.
Calculate
(a) the current in the resistance wire
(b) the power lost in the copper connecting wire
(c) the supply voltage required to maintain 50 V across the heater itself.
Solution. (a) Current = wattage/voltage = 1250/50 = 25 A
(b) Resistance of one copper conductor = 0.006 × 100 = 0.6 Ω
Resistance of both copper conductors = 0.6 × 2 = 1.2 Ω
Power loss = I2R watts = 252 × 1.2 = 750 W
(c) Voltage drop over connecting copper wire = IR volt = 25 × 1.2 = 30 V
∴ Supply voltage required = 50 + 30 = 80 V
Example 3.5. A factory has a 240-V supply from which the following loads are taken :
Lighting : Three hundred 150-W, four hundred 100 W and five hundred 60-W lamps
Heating : 100 kW
Motors : A total of 44.76 kW (60 b.h.p.) with an average efficiency of 75 percent
Misc. : Various load taking a current of 40 A.180 Electrical Technology
Assuming that the lighting load is on for a period of 4 hours/day, the heating for 10 hours per
day and the remainder for 2 hours/day, calculate the weekly consumption of the factory in kWh when
working on a 5-day week.
What current is taken when the lighting load only is
switched on ?
Solution. The power consumed by each load can be
tabulated as given below :
Power consumed
Lighting 300 × 150 = 45,000 = 45 kW
400 × 100 = 40,000 = 40 kW
500 × 60 = 30,000 = 30 kW
A factory needs electric power for lighting
Total = 115 kW
and running motors
Heating = 100 kW
Motors = 44.76/0.75 = 59.7 kW
Misc. = 240 × 40/1000 = 9.6 kW
Similarly, the energy consumed/day can be tabulated as follows :
Energy consumed / day
Lighting = 115 kW × 4 hr = 460 kWh
Heating = 100 kW × 10 hr = 1,000 kWh
Motors = 59.7 kW × 2 hr = 119.4 kWh
Misc. = 9.6 kW × 2 hr = 19.2 kWh
Total daily consumption = 1,598.6 kWh
Weekly consumption = 1,598.6 × 5 = 7,993 kWh
Current taken by the lighting load alone = 115 × 1000/240 = 479 A
Example 3.6. A Diesel-electric generating set supplies an
output of 25 kW. The calorific value of the fuel oil used is 12,500
kcal/kg. If the overall efficiency of the unit is 35% (a) calculate
the mass of oil required per hour (b) the electric energy generated
per tonne of the fuel.
Solution. Output = 25 kW, Overall η = 0.35,
Input = 25/0.35 = 71.4 kW
∴ input per hour =71.4 kWh = 71.4 × 860 = 61,400 kcal
Since 1 kg of fuel-oil produces 12,500 kcal
(a) ∴ mass of oil required = 61,400/12,500 = 4.91 kg Diesel electric generator set
(b) 1 tonne of fuel = 1000 kg
Heat content = 1000 × 12,500 = 12.5 × 106 kcal
= 12.5 × 106/860 = 14,530 kWh
Overall η = 0.35% ∴energy output = 14,530 × 0.35 = 5,088 kWh
Example 3.7. The effective water head for a 100 MW station is 220 metres. The station supplies
full load for 12 hours a day. If the overall efficiency of the station is 86.4%, find the volume of water
used.
Solution. Energy supplied in 12 hours = 100 × 12 = 1200 MWh
= 12 × 105 kWh = 12 × 105 × 35 × 105 J = 43.2 × 1011 J
Overall η = 86.4% = 0.864 ∴ Energy input = 43.2 × 1011/0.864 = 5 × 1012 J
Suppose m kg is the mass of water used in 12 hours, then m × 9.81 × 220 = 5 × 1012
∴ m = 5 × 1012/9.81 × 220 = 23.17 × 108 kg
Volume of water = 23.17 × 108/103 = 23.17 ××××× 105 m3

Example 3.8. Calculate the current required by a 1,500 volts d.c. locomotive when drawing
100 tonne load at 45 km.p.h. with a tractive resistance of 5 kg/tonne along (a) level track
(b) a gradient of 1 in 50. Assume a motor efficiency of 90 percent.
Solution. As shown in Fig. 3.1 (a), in this case, force required is equal to the tractive resistance
only.
(a) Force required at the rate of 5 kg-wt/tonne = 100 × 5 kg-wt. = 500 × 9.81 = 4905 N
Distance travelled/second = 45 × 1000/3600 = 12.5 m/s
Power output of the locomotive = 4905 × 12.5 J/s or watt = 61,312 W
η = 0.9 ∴ Power input = 61,312/0.9 = 68,125 W
∴ Currnet drawn = 68,125/1500 = 45.41 A
Fig. 3.1
(b) When the load is drawn along the gradient [Fig. 3.1 (b)], component of the weight acting
downwards = 100 × 1/50 = 2 tonne-wt = 2000 kg-wt = 2000 × 9.81 = 19,620 N
Total force required = 19,620 + 4,905 = 24,525 N
Power output = force × velocity = 24,525 × 12.5 watt
24,525×12.5

Example 3.9. A room measures 4 m × 7 m × 5 m and the air in it has to be always kept 15°C
higher than that of the incoming air. The air inside has to be renewed every 35 minutes. Neglecting
radiation loss, calculate the rating of the heater suitable for this purpose. Take specific heat of air as
0.24 and density as 1.27 kg/m3.
Solution. Volume of air to be changed per second = 4 × 7 × 5/35 = 60 = 1/15 m3
Mass of air to be changed/second = (1/15) × 1.27 kg
Heat required/second = mass/second × sp. heat × rise in temp.
= (1.27/15) × 0.24 × 15 kcal/s = 0.305 kcal/s
= 0.305 × 4186 J/s = 1277 watt.
Example 3.10. A motor is being self-started against a resisting torque of 60 N-m and at each
start, the engine is cranked at 75 r.p.m. for 8 seconds. For each start, energy is drawn from a lead-
acid battery. If the battery has the capacity of 100 Wh, calculate the number of starts that can be
made with such a battery. Assume an overall efficiency of the motor and gears as 25%.
(Principles of Elect. Engg.-I, Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. Angular speed ω= 2π N/60 rad/s = 2π × 75/60 = 7.85 rad/s
Power required for rotating the engine at this angular speed is
P = torque × angular speed = ωT watt = 60 × 7.85 = 471 W182 Electrical Technology
Energy required per start is = power × time per start = 471 × 8 = 3,768 watt-s = 3,768 J
= 3,768/3600 = 1.047 Wh
Energy drawn from the battery taking into consideration the efficiency of the motor and gearing
= 1.047/0.25 = 4.188 Wh
No. of start possible with a fully-charged battery = 100/4.188 = 24 (approx.)
Example 3.11. Find the amount of electrical energy expended in raising the temperature of
45 litres of water by 75ºC. To what height could a weight of 5 tonnes be raised with the expenditure
of the same energy ? Assume efficiencies of the heating equipment and lifting equipment to be 90%
and 70% respectively. (Elect. Engg. A.M. Ae. S.I.)
Solution. Mass of water heated = 45 kg. Heat required = 45 × 75 = 3,375 kcal
Heat produced electrically = 3,375/0.9 = 3,750 kcal. Now, 1 kcal = 4,186 J
∴ electrical energy expended = 3,750 × 4,186 J
Energy available for lifting the load is = 0.7 × 3,750 × 4,186 J
If h metre is the height through which the load of 5 tonnes can be lifted, then potential energy of
the load = mgh joules = 5 × 1000 × 9.81 h joules
∴ 5000 × 9.81 × h = 0.7 × 3,750 × 4,186 ∴ h = 224 metres
Example 3.12. An hydro-electric station has a turbine of efficiency 86% and a generator of
efficiency 92%. The effective head of water is 150 m. Calculate the volume of water used when
delivering a load of 40 MW for 6 hours. Water weighs 1000 kg/m3.
Solution. Energy output = 40 × 6 = 240 MWh
= 240 × 103 × 36 × 105 = 864 × 109 J
Overall η = 0.86 × 0.92 ∴ Energy input =
864×109
= 10.92 × 1011 J
0.86×0.92
Since the head is 150 m and 1 m3 of water weighs 1000 kg, energy contributed by each m3 of
water = 150 × 1000 m-kg (wt) = 150 × 1000 × 9.81 J = 147.2 × 104 J
10.92×1011
∴ Volume of water for the required energy = = 74.18 ××××× 104 m3

Example 3.13. An hydroelectric generating station is supplied form a reservoir of capacity 6 million m3 at
a head of 170 m.
(i) What is the available energy in kWh if the hydraulic efficiency be 0.8 and the electrical
efficiency 0.9 ?
(ii) Find the fall in reservoir level after a load of 12,000 kW has been supplied for 3 hours, the
area of the reservoir is 2.5 km2.
(iii) If the reservoir is supplied by a river at the rate of 1.2 m3/s, what does this flow represent in
kW and kWh/day ? Assume constant head and efficiency.
Water weighs 1 tonne/m3. (Elect. Engineering-I, Osmania Univ.)
Solution. (i) Wt. of water W = 6 × 106 × 1000 kg wt = 6 × 109 × 9.81 N
Water head = 170 m
Potential energy stored in this much water
= Wh = 6 × 109 × 9.81 × 170 J = 1012 J
Overall efficiency of the station = 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.71
∴ energy available = 0.72 × 1013 J = 72 × 1011/36 × 105
= 2 ××××× 106 kWh
(ii) Energy supplied = 12,000 × 3 = 36,000 kWh
Energy drawn from the reservoir after taking into consideration the overall efficiency of the
station = 36,000/0.72 = 5 × 104 kWh
= 5 × 104 × 36 × 105 = 18 × 1010 JWork, Power and Energy 183
If m kg is the mass of water used in two hours, then, since water head is 170 m
mgh = 18 × 1010
or m × 9.81 × 170 = 18 × 1010 ∴ m = 1.08 × 108 kg
If h metre is the fall in water level, then
h × area × density = mass of water
∴ h × (2.5 × 106) × 1000 = 1.08 × 108 ∴ h = 0.0432 m = 4.32 cm
(iii) Mass of water stored per second = 1.2 × 1000 = 1200 kg
Wt. of water stored per second = 1200 × 9.81 N
Power stored = 1200 × 9.81 × 170 J/s = 2,000 kW
Power actually available = 2,000 × 0.72 = 1440 kW
Energy delivered /day = 1440 × 24 = 34,560 kWh
Example 3.14. The reservoir for a hydro-electric
station is 230 m above the turbine house. The annual
replenishment of the reservoir is 45 × 1010 kg. What is
the energy available at the generating station bus-bars if
the loss of head in the hydraulic system is 30 m and the
overall efficiency of the station is 85%. Also, calculate
the diameter of the steel pipes needed if a maximum de-
mand of 45 MW is to be supplied using two pipes.
(Power System, Allahabad Univ.)
Solution. Actual head available = 230 − 30 = 200 m
Hydroelectric generators
Energy available at the turbine house = mgh
= 45 × 1010 × 9.81 × 200 = 88.29 × 1013 J
=
88.29×1013
= 24.52 ××××× 107 kWh
36×105
Overall η = 0.85
∴ Energy output = 24.52 × 107 × 0.85 = 20.84 ××××× 107 kWh
The kinetic energy of water is just equal to its loss of potential energy.
1
mv2 = mgh ∴ν = 2gh = 2×9.81×200 = 62.65 m/s
2
Power available from a mass of m kg when it flows with a velocity of ν m/s is
1 1
P = mν2 = × m × 62.652 J/s or W
2 2
Equating this to the maximum demand on the station, we get
1
m 62.652 = 45 × 106 ∴ m = 22,930 kg/s
2
If A is the total area of the pipes in m2, then the flow of water is Aν m3/s. Mass of water flowing/
second = Aν × 103 kg (∴ 1 m3 of water = 1000 kg)
∴ A × ν × 103 = 22,930 orA = 22,930 = 0.366 m2
62.65×103
If ‘d’ is the diameter of each pipe, then πd2/4 = 0.183 ∴ d = 0.4826 m
Example 3.15. A large hydel power station has a head of 324 m and an average flow of 1370
cubic metres/sec. The reservoir is a lake covering an area of 6400 sq. km, Assuming an efficiency of
90% for the turbine and 95% for the generator, calculate
(i) the available electric power ;
(ii) the number of days this power could be supplied for a drop in water level by 1 metre.
(AMIE Sec. B Power System I (E-6) Winter)184 Electrical Technology
Solution. (i) Available power = 9.81 η QH kW = (0.9 × 0.95) × 1370 × 324 = 379, 524 kW =
379.52 MW.
(ii) If A is the lake area in m2 and h metre is the fall in water level, the volume of water used is
= A × h = m3. The time required to discharge this water is Ah / Q second.
Now, A = 6400 × 106 m2 ; h = 1 m; Q = 1370 m3 /s.
∴ t = 6400 × 106 × 1/1370 = 4.67 × 106 second = 540686 days
Example 3.16. The reservoir area of a hydro-electric generat-
ing plant is spread over an area of 4 sq km with a storage capacity of
8 million cubic-metres. The net head of water available to the tur-
bine is 70 metres. Assuming an efficiency of 0.87 and 0.93 for water
turbine and generator respectively, calculate the electrical energy
generated by the plant.
Estimate the difference in water level if a load of 30 MW is
continuously supplied by the generator for 6 hours.
(Power System I-AMIE Sec. B) In a hydel plant, potential energy
of water is converted into kinetic
Solution. Since 1 cubic metre of water weighs 1000 kg., the energy and then into electricity.
reservoir capacity = 8 × 106 m3 = 8 × 106 × 1000 kg. = 8 × 109 kg.
Wt. of water, W = 8 × 109 kg. Wt. 8 × 109 × 9.81 = 78.48 × 109 N. Net water head = 70 m.
Potential energy stored in this much water = Wh = 78.48 × 109 × 70 = 549.36 × 1010J
Overall efficiency of the generating plant = 0.87 × 0.93 = 0.809
Energy available = 0.809 × 549.36 × 1010 J = 444.4 × 1010 J
= 444.4 × 1010/36 × 105 = 12.34 ××××× 105 kWh
Energy supplied in 6 hours = 30 MW × 6 h = 180 MWh
= 180,000 kWh
Energy drawn from the reservoir after taking into consideration, the overall efficiency of the
station = 180,000/0.809 = 224,500 kWh = 224,500 × 36 × 105
= 80.8 × 1010 J
If m kg. is the mass of water used in 6 hours, then since water head is 70 m,
mgh = 80.8 × 1010 or m × 9.81 × 70 = 80.8 × 1010 ∴ m = 1.176 × 109 kg.
If h is the fall in water level, then h × area × density = mass of water
∴ h × (4 × 106) × 1000 = 1.176 × 109 ∴ h = 0.294 m = 29.4 cm.
Example 3.17. A proposed hydro-electric station has an available head of 30 m, catchment
area of 50 × 106 sq.m, the rainfall for which is 120 cm per annum. If 70% of the total rainfall can be
collected, calculate the power that could be generated. Assume the following efficiencies : Penstock
95%, Turbine 80% and Generator 85. (Elect. Engg. AMIETE Sec. A Part II)
Solution. Volume of water available = 0.7(50 × 106 × 1.2) = 4.2 × 107m3
Mass of water available = 4.2 × 107 × 1000 = 4.2 × 1010 kg
This quantity of water is available for a period of one year. Hence, quantity available per second
= 4.2 × 1010/365 × 24 × 3600 = 1.33 × 103.
Available head = 30 m
Potential energy available = mgh = 1.33 × 103 × 9.8 × 30 = 391 × 103 J
Since this energy is available per second, hence power available is = 391 × 103 J/s = 391× 103 W
= 391 kW
Overall efficiency = 0.95 × 0.80 × 0.85 = 0.646
The power that could be generated = 391 × 0.646 = 253 kW.
Example 3.18. In a hydro-electric generating station, the mean head (i.e. the difference of
height between the mean level of the water in the lake and the generating station) is 400 metres. If
the overall efficiency of the generating stations is 70%, how many litres of water are required to
generate 1 kWh of electrical energy ? Take one litre of water to have a mass of 1 kg.
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)Work, Power and Energy 185
Solution. Output energy = 1 kWh = 36 × 105 J
Input energy = 36 × 105/0.7 = 5.14 × 106 J
If m kg. water is required, then
mgh = 5.14 × 106 or m × 9.81 × 400 = 5.14 × 106, ∴ = 1310 kg.
Example 3.19. A 3-tonne electric-motor-operated vehicle is being driven at a speed of 24 km/hr
upon an incline of 1 in 20. The tractive resistance may be taken as 20 kg per tonne. Assuming a motor
efficiency of 85% and the mechanical efficiency between the motor and road wheels of 80%, calculate
(a) the output of the motor
(b) the current taken by motor if it gets power from a 220-V source.
Calculate also the cost of energy for a run of 48 km, taking energy charge as 40 paise/kWh.
Solution. Different forces acting on the vehicle are shown in Fig. 3.2.
Wt. of the vehicle = 3 × 103 = 3000 kg-wt
Component of the weight of the vehicle acting downwards along the slope = 3000 × 1/20 = 150
kg-wt
Tractive resistance = 3 × 20 = 60 kg-wt
Total downward force = 150 + 60 = 210 kg-wt
= 210 × 9.81 = 2,060 N
Distance travelled/second = 24,000/3600 = 20/3 m/s
Output at road wheels = 2,060 × 20/3 watt
Mechanical efficiency = 80% or 0.8
2,060×20
(a) Motor output = 3×0.8 = 17,167 W Fig. 3.2
(b) Motor input = 17,167/0.85 = 20,200 W
Current drawn = 20,200/220 = 91.7 A
Motor power input = 20,200 W = 20.2 kW
Time for 48 km run = 2 hr.
∴ Motor energy input = 20.2 × 2 = 40.4 kW
Cost = Rs. 40.4 × 0.4 = Rs. 16 paise 16
Example 3.20. Estimate the rating of an induction furnace to melt two tonnes of zinc in one
hour if it operates at an efficiency of 70%. Specific heat of zinc is 0.1. Latent heat of fusion of zinc
is 26.67 kcal per kg. Melting point is 455ºC. Assume the initial temperature to be 25ºC.
(Electric Drives and Utilization Punjab Univ.)
Solution. Heat required to bring 2000 kg of zinc from 25°C to the melting temperature of
455° C = 2000 × 0.1 × (455 − 25) = 86,000 kcal.
Heat of fusion or melting = mL = 2000 × 26.67 = 53,340 kcal
Total heat reqd. = 86,000 + 53,340 = 139,340 kcal
Furnace input = 139,340/0.7 = 199,057 kcal
Now, 860 kcal = 1 kWh ∴ furnace input = 199.057/860 = 231.5 kWh.
Power rating of furnace = energy input/time = 231.5 kWh/1 h = 231.5 kW.
Example 3.21. A pump driven by an electric motor lifts 1.5 m3 of water per minute to a height
of 40 m. The pump has an efficiency of 90% and motor has an efficiency of 85%. Determine : (a) the
power input to the motor. (b) The current taken from 480 V supply. (c) The electric energy consumed
when motor runs at this load for 4 hours. Assume mass of 1 m3 of water to be 1000 kg.
(Elect. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. (a) Weight of the water lifted = 1.5 m3 = 1.5 × 1000 = 1500 kg. Wt = 1500 × 9.8 =
14700 N.
Height = 40 m; time taken = 1 min. = 60 s
∴ Motor output power = 14700 × 40/60 = 9800 W
Combined pump and motor efficiency = 0.9 × 0.85
∴ Motor power input = 9800/0.9 × 0.85 = 12810 W = 12.81 kW.186 Electrical Technology
(b) Current drawn by the motor = 12810/480 = 26.7 A
Electrical energy consumed by the motor = 12.81 kW × 4 h = 51.2 kWh.
Example 3.22. An electric lift is required to raise a load of 5 tonne through a height of 30 m.
One quarter of electrical energy supplied to the lift is lost in the motor and gearing. Calculate the
energy in kWhr supplied. If the time required to raise the load is 27 minutes, find the kW rating of the
motor and the current taken by the motor, the supply voltage being 230 V d.c. Assume the efficiency
of the motor at 90%. (Elect. Engg. A.M. Ae. S.I. June)
Solution. Work done by the lift = Wh = mgh = (5 × 1000) × 9.8 × 30 = 1.47 × 106 J
Since 25% of the electric current input is wasted, the energy supplied to the lift is 75% of the
input.
∴ input energy to the lift = 1.47 × 106/0.75 = 1.96 × 106 J
Now, 1 kWh = 26 × 105 J
∴ energy input to the lift = 1.96 × 106/36 × 105 = 0.544 kWh
Motor energy output = 1.96 × 106 J; η = 0.9
Motor energy input = 1.96 × 106/0.9 = 2.18 × 106 J : time taken = 27 × 60 = 1620 second
Power rating of the electric motor = work done/time taken
= 2.18 × 106/1620 = 1.345 × 103 J/s = 1345 W
Current taken by the motor = 1345/230 = 5.85 A
Example 3.23. An electrical lift make 12 double journey per hour. A load of 5 tonnes is raised
by it through a height 50 m and it returns empty. The lift takes 65 seconds to go up and 48 seconds to
return. The weight of the cage is 1/2 tonne and that of the counterweight is 2.5 tonne. The efficiency
of the hoist is 80 per cent that of the motor is 85 %. Calculate the hourly consumption in kWh.
(Elect. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. The lift is shown in Fig. 3.3.
Weight raised during upward journey
= 5 + 1/2 − 2.5 = 3 tonne = 3000 kg-wt
Distance travelled = 50 m
Work done during upward journey
= 3000 × 50 = 15 × 104 m-kg
Weight raised during downward journey
= 2.5 − 0.5 = 2 tonne = 2000 kg
Similarly, work done during downward journey
= 2000 × 50 = 10 × 10 −4 m-kg.
Total work done per double journey
= 15 × 104 + 10 × 104 = 25 × 104 m-kg Fig. 3.3
Now, 1, m-kg = 9.8 joules
∴ Work done per double journey = 9.8 × 25 × 104 J = 245 × 104 J
No. of double journey made per hour = 12
∴ work done per hour = 12 × 245 × 104 = 294 × 105 J
Energy drawn from supply = 294 × 105/0.8 × 0.85 = 432.3 ×105 J
Now, 1 kWh = 36 × 105 J
∴ Energy consumption per hour = 432.3 × 105/36 × 105 = 12 kWh
Example 3.24. An electric hoist makes 10 double journey per hour. In each journey, a load of
6 tonnes is raised to a height of 60 meters in 90 seconds. The hoist cage weighs 1/2 tonne and has a
balance load of 3 tonnes. The efficiency of the hoist is 80 % and of the driving motor 88 %. Calcu-
late (a) electric energy absorbed per double journey (b) hourly energy consumption in kWh (c) hp
(British) rating of the motor required (d) cost of electric energy if hoist works for 4 hours/day for 30
days. Cost per kWh is 50 paise. (Elect. Power - 1, Bangalore Univ.)Work, Power and Energy 187

Force exerted on downward journey = 3− 1 =2 1 tonnes-wt. = 2500 kg-wt
2 2
Distance moved = 60 m
Work done during upward journey = 3,500 × 60 m-kg
Work done during downward journey = 2,500 × 60 m-kg
Work done during each double journey = (3,500 + 2,500) × 60 = 36 × 104 m-kg
= 36 × 104 × 9.81 = 534 × 104 J
Overall η = 0.80 × 0.88
∴ Energy input per double journey = 534 × 104/0.8 × 0.88 = 505 × 104 J
(a) Electric energy absorbed per double journey = 505 × 104/36 × 105 = 1.402 kWh
(b) Hourly consumption = 1.402 × 10 = 14.02 kWh
(c) Before calculating the rating of the motor, maximum rate of working should be found. It is
seen that maximum rate of working is required in the upward journey.

Example 3.25. A current of 80 A flows for 1 hr, in a resistance across which there is a voltage
of 2 V. Determine the velocity with which a weight of 1 tonne must move in order that its kinetic
energy shall be equal to the energy dissipated in the resistance.
(Elect. Engg. A.M.A.e. S.I.)
Solution. Energy dissipated in the resistance = V It = 2 × 80 × 3600 = 576,000 J
A weight of one tonne represents a mass of one tonne i.e., 1000 kg. Its kinetic energy is = (1/2)
× 1000 × v 2 = 500 v 2
∴ 500 v 2 = 576,000 ∴ v = 1152 m/s.

4.1. Static Electricity
In the preceding chapters, we concerned ourselves exclusively with electric current i.e. electric-
ity in motion. Now, we will discuss the behaviour of static electricity and the laws governing it. In
fact, electrostatics is that branch of science which deals with the phenomena associated with electric-
ity at rest.
It has been already discussed that generally an atom is electrically neutral i.e. in a normal atom
the aggregate of positive charge of protons is exactly equal to the aggregate of negative charge of the
electrons.
If, somehow, some electrons are removed from the atoms of a body, then it is left with a
preponderance of positive charge. It is then said to be positively-charged. If, on the other hand, some
electrons are added to it, negative charge out-balances the positive charge and the body is said to be
negatively charged.
In brief, we can say that positive electrification of a body results from a deficiency of the electrons
whereas negative electrification results from an excess of electrons.
The total deficiency or excess of electrons in a body is known as its charge.
4.2. Absolute and Relative Permittivity of a Medium
While discussing electrostatic phenomenon, a certain property of the
medium called its permittivity plays an important role. Every medium is
supposed to possess two permittivities :
(i) absolute permittivity (ε) and (ii) relative permittivity (ε ).
r
For measuring relative permittivity, vacuum or free space is chosen as
the reference medium. It has an absolute permittivity of 8.854 × 10 −12 F/m
Absolute permittivity ε = 8.854 × 10 −12 F/m
0
Relative permittivity, ε = 1
r Charles Augustin de
Being a ratio of two similar quantities, ε has no units. Coulomb*
r
Now, take any other medium. If its relative permittivity, as compared to vacuum is ε , then its
r
absolute permittivity is ε = ε ε F/m
0 r
If, for example, relative permittivity of mica is 5, then, its absolute permittivity is
ε = ε ε = 8.854 × 10 −12 × 5 = 44.27 × 10 −12 F/m
0 r
4.3. Laws of Electrostatics
First Law. Like charges of electricity repel each other, whereas unlike charges attract each other.
Second Law. According to this law, the force exerted between two point charges (i) is directly
proportional to the product of their strengths (ii) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
This law is known as Coulomb’s Law and can be expressed mathematically as :

then Q2 = 1 or Q = ± 1 coulomb
Hence, one coulomb of charge may be defined as
that charge (or quantity of electricity) which when
placed in air (strictly vacuum) from an equal and
similar charge repels it with a force of 9××××× 109 N.
Although coulomb is found to be a unit of conve-
nient size in dealing with electric current, yet, from
the standpoint of electrostatics, it is an enormous unit.
Hence, its submultiples like micro-coulomb (μ C) and
micro-microcoulomb (μ μC) are generally used.

Obviously, this force is negligible as compared to the electrostatic force between the two
particles.
Example 4.2. Calculate the distance of separation between two electrons (in vacuum) for which
the electric force between them is equal to the gravitation force on one of them at the earth surface.

Example 4.3. (a) Three identical point charges, each QΩ coulombs, are placed at the vertices
of an equilateral triangle 10 cm apart. Calculate the force on each charge.
(b) Two charges Q coulomb each are placed at two opposite corners of a square. What addi-
tional charge “q” placed at each of the other two corners will reduce the resultant electric force on
each of the charges Q to zero ?
Solution. (a) The equilateral triangle with its three charges is shown in Fig. 4.2 (a). Consider
the charge Q respectively. These forces are equal to each other and each is

Since the angle between these two equal forces is 60º, their resultant is

The force experienced by other charges is also the same.
(b) The various charges are shown in Fig. 4.2 (b). The force experienced by the charge Q at
point C due to the charge Q at point A acts along ACM and is

brought into contact and then separated by 4 cm, what is the force between them ?

Solution. F = 9 × 10 −9 Q Q /d2 = 9 × 10 −9 × (− 0.5 × 10 −9)/0.042 = − 56.25 × 10 −7 N. When two

4.4. Electric Field
It is found that in the medium around a charge a force acts on a positive or negative charge when
placed in that medium. If the charge is sufficiently large, then it may create such a huge stress as to
cause the electrical rupture of the medium, followed by the passage of an arc discharge.
Fig. 4.4 (a) Fig. 4.4 (b)
The region in which the stress exists or in which electric forces act, is called an electric field or
electrostatic field.
The stress is represented by imaginary lines of forces. The direction of the lines of force at any
point is the direction along which a unit positive charge placed at that point would move if free to do
so. It was suggested by Faraday that the electric field should be imagined to be divided into tubes of
force containing a fixed number of lines of force. He assumed these tubes to the elastic and having
the property of contracting longitudinally the repelling laterally. With the help of these properties, it
becomes easy to explain (i) why unlike charges attract each other and try to come nearer to each other
and (ii) why like charges repel each other [Fig. 4.4 (a)].
However, it is more common to use the term lines of force. These lines are supposed to emanate
from a positive charge and end on a negative charge [Fig. 4.4 (b)]. These lines always leave or enter
a conducting surface normally.
4.5. Electrostatic Induction
It is found that when an uncharged body is brought near a charged body, it acquires some charge.
This phenomenon of an uncharged body getting charged merely by the nearness of a charged body is
known as induction. In Fig. 4.5, a positively-charged body A is brought close to a perfectly-insulatedElectrostatics 195
uncharged body B. It is found that the end of B nearer to A gets negatively charged whereas further
end becomes positively charged. The negative and positive charges of B are known as induced
charges. The negative charge of B is called ‘bound’ charge because it must remain on B so long as
positive charge of A remains there. However, the positive charge on the farther end of B is called free
charge. In Fig. 4.6, the body B has been earthed by a wire. The positive charge flows to earth leaving
negative charge behind. If next A is removed, then this negative charge will also go to earth, leaving
B uncharged. It is found that :
(i) a positive charge induces a negative charge and vice-versa.
(ii) each of the induced charges is equal to the inducing charge.

A unit tube of flux is one in which the196 Electrical Technology
end charge is one unit of charge.
In the S.I. system of units, one such tube of flux is supposed to start from a positive charge of one
coulomb and terminate on a negative charge of the same amount.
A unit tube of flux is known as Faraday tube. If the charge on a conductor is ± Q coulombs, then
the number of Faraday tubes starting or terminating on it also Q.
The number of Faraday tubes of flux passing through a surface in an electric field is called the
electric flux (or dielectric flux) through that surface. Electric flux is represented by the symbol ψ.
Since electric flux is numerically equal to the charge, it is measured in coulombs.
Hence, ψ = Q coulombs
Note. It may also be noted that ‘tubes of flux’ passing per unit area through a medium are also supposed
to measure the ‘electric displacement’ of that dielectric medium. In that case, they are referred to as lines of
displacement and are equal to ε times the lines of force (Art. 4.8). It is important to differentiate between the
‘tubes of flux’ and ‘lines of force’ and to remember that if Q is the charge, then
tubes of flux = Q and lines of force = Q/εεεεε
4.7. Field Strength or Field Intensity or Electric Intensity (E)
Electric intensity at any point within an electric field may be defined in either of the following
three ways :
(a) It is given by the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point. Its direc-
tion is the direction along which the force acts.
Obviously, the unit of E is newton/coulomb (N/C).
For example, if a charge of Q coulombs placed at a particular point P within an electric field
instances a force of F newton, then electric field at that point is given by
E = F/Q N/C
The value of E within the field due to a point charge can be found with help of Coulomb’s laws.
Suppose it is required to find the electric field at a point A situated at a distance of d metres from a
charge of Q coulombs. Imagine a positive charge of one coulomb placed at that point (Fig. 4.8). The
force experienced by this charge is

(b) Electric intensity at a point may be defined as equal to the lines of force passing normally
through a unit cross-section at that point. Suppose, there is a charge of Q coulombs. The number ofElectrostatics 197
lines of force produced by it is Q/ε. If these lines fall normally on an area of A m2 surrounding the
point, then electric intensity at that point is

E = A εA
Now Q/A = D —the flux density over the area
∴ E = D ε = ε D ε —in a medium

The unit of E is volt/metre.
(c) Electric intensity at any point in an electric field is equal to the potential gradient at that
point.
In other words, E is equal to the rate of fall of potential in the direction of the lines of force.

∴ E =

Obviously, the unit of E is volt/metre.
It may be noted that E and D are vector quantities having magnitude and direction.

Solution. Electric intensity at point D (3, 4) due to positive charge at point A is
E = 9 × 109 Q/d2 = 9 × 109 × 5 × 10 −8/52 = 18 V/m

As shown in Fig. 4.9, it acts along AD.

1 2
= − 49.2
Y-component = E sin θ + E = 18 sin 53°8′ + 22.5 = 36.9
1 2
∴ E = (−49.2)2 + 36.92 = 61.5 V/m.
It acts along DE such that tan φ = 36.9/49.2 = 0.75. Fig. 4.9
Hence φ = 36.9°.
Example 4.8. An electron has a velocity of 1.5 × 107 m/s at right angles to the uniform electric
field between two parallel deflecting plates of a cathode-ray tube. If the plates are 2.5 cm long and

In other words, the product of electric intensity E at any point within a dielectric medium and the
absolute permittivity ε (= ε , ε ) at the same point is called the displacement at that point.

Like electric intensity E, electric displacement D** is also a vector quantity (see 4.7) whose
direction at every point is the same as that of E but whose magnitude is ε ε times E. As E is

represented by lines of force, similarly D may also be represented by lines called lines of electric

displacement. The tangent to these lines at any point gives the direction of D at that point and the
number of lines per unit area perpendicular to their direction is numerically equal to the electric
displacement at that point. Hence, the number of lines of electric displacement per unit area (D) is ε ,

r
It should be noted that whereas the value of E depends on the permittivity of the surrounding
medium, that of D is independent of it.
One useful property of D is that its surface integral over any closed surface equals the enclosed
charge (Art. 4.9).
Let us find the value of D at a point distant r metres from a point charge of Q coulombs. Imagine
a sphere of radius r metres surrounding the charge. Total flux = Q coulombs and it falls normally on
a surface area of 4 π r2 metres. Hence, electric flux density.

4.9. Gauss* Law
Consider a point charge Q lying at the centre of a sphere of radius r which surrounds it com-
pletely [Fig. 4.11 (a)]. The total number of tubes of flux originating from the charge is Q (but number
of lines of force is Q/ε ) and are normal to the surface of the sphere. The electric field E which equals
0
Q/4 π ε r2 is also normal to the surface. As said earlier, total number of lines of force passing

perpendicularly through the whole surface of the sphere is

Now, suppose we draw another sphere surrounding the charge [Fig. 4.11 (b)] but whose centre
does not lie at the charge but elsewhere. In this case also, the number of tubes of flux emanating from
the charge is Q and lines of force is Q.ε though they are not normal to the surface. These can,
0
however, be split up into cos θ components and sin θ components. If we add up sin θ components all
over the surface, they will be equal to zero . But if add up cos θ components over the whole surface
of the sphere, the normal flux will again come out to be Q (or lines of force will come out to be Q/ε ).
0
Hence, it shows that irrespective of where the charge Q is placed within a closed surface completely
surrounding it, the total normal flux is Q and the total number of lines of force passing out normally
isQ/ε .
0
In fact, as shown in Fig. 4.12, if there are placed charges of value Q , Q , − Q inside a closed

surface, the total i.e. net charge enclosed by the surface is (Q + Q − Q )/ε through the closed

This is the meaning of Gauss’s law which may be stated thus : the surface integral of the normal
component of the electric intensity E over a closed surface is equal to 1/ε times the total charge

4.10. The Equations of Poisson and Laplace
These equations are useful in the solution of many
problems concerning electrostatics especially the problem
of space charge* present in an electronic valve. The two
equations can be derived by applying Gauss’s theorem.
Consider the electric field set up between two charged
plates P and Q [Fig. 4.14 (a)]. Suppose there is some
electric charge present in the space between the two plates.
It is, generally, known as the space charge. Let the space
charge density be ρ coulomb/metre3. It will be assumed
that the space charge density varies from one point of space
Fig. 4.14
to the another but is uniform throughout any thin layer
taken parallel to the plates P and Q. If X-axis is taken
perpendicular to the plates, then ρ is assumed to depend on the value of x. It will be seen from Fig.
4.14 (a) that the value of electric intensity E increases with x because of the space charge.
Now, consider a thin volume element of cross-section A and thickness Δ x as shown in Fig.4.14(b).
The values of electric intensity at the two opposite faces of this element are E and (E + Δ E). If
dE/dx represents the rate of increases of electric intensity with distance, then
∂ E ∂ E
Δ E = ×Δ x ∴ E + Δ E = E + × Δ x

* Such a space charge exists in the space between the cathode and anode of a vacuum tube.202 Electrical Technology

⎝ ∂ x ⎠
The surface integral over the left-hand face of the element is = − E × A
The negative sign represents the fact that E is directed inwards over this face.
The surface integral over the entire surface, i.e., the closed surface of the element is
⎛ ∂ E ⎞ ∂ E
= ⎜E + .Δ x⎟ A− E × A= A.Δ x. . From symmetry it is evident that along with y and
⎝ ∂ x ⎠ ∂ x
z there is no field.
Now, according to Gauss’s theorem (Art. 4.9), the surface integral of electric intensity over a
closed surface is equal to 1/ε time the charge within that surface.

4.11. Electric Potential and Energy
We know that a body raised above the ground level has a certain amount of mechanical potential
energy which, by definition, is given by the amount of work done in raising it to that height. If, for
example, a body of 5 kg is raised against gravity through 10
m, then the potential energy of the body is 5 × 10 = 50 m-kg.
wt. = 50 × 9.8 = 490 joules. The body falls because there is
attraction due to gravity and always proceeds from a place of
higher potential energy to one of lower potential energy. So,
we speak of gravitational potential energy or briefly ‘poten-
tial’ at different points in the earth’s gravitational field.
Now, consider an electric field. Imagine an isolated
positive charge Q placed in air (Fig. 4.15). Like earth’s
gravitational field, it has its own electrostatic field which
theoretically extends upto infinity. If the charge X is very far
away from Q, say, at infinity, then force on it is practically

zero. As X is lightning can be created in the
brought nearer to laboratory, in a miature scale.
Q, a force of
repulsion acts on it (as similar charges repel each other),
hence work or energy is required to bring it to a point like A
Fig. 4.15
in the electric field. Hence, when at point A, charge X hasElectrostatics 203
some amount of electric potential energy. Similar other points in the field will also have some potential
energy. In the gravitational field, usually ‘sea level’ is chosen as the place of ‘zero’ potential. In
electric field infinity is chosen as the theoretical place of ‘zero’ potential although, in practice, earth
is chosen as ‘zero’ potential, because earth is such a large conductor that its potential remains practically
constant although it keeps on losing and gaining electric charge every day.
4.12. Potential and Potential Difference
As explained above, the force acting on a charge at infinity is zero, hence ‘infinity’ is chosen as
the theoretical place of zero electric potential. Therefore, potential at any point in an electric field
may be defined as
numerically equal to the work done in bringing a positive charge of one coulomb from infin-
ity to that point against the electric field.
The unit of this potential will depend on the unit of charge taken and the work done.
If, in shifting one coulomb from infinity to a certain point in the electric field, the work done is
one joule, then potential of that ponit is one volt.
Obviously, potential is work per unit charge,
1 joule
∴ 1 volt =
1coulomb
Similarly, potential difference (p.d.) of one volt exists between two points if one joule of work is
done in shifting a charge of one coulomb from one point to the other.
4.13.Potential at a Point
Consider a positive point charge of Q coulombs placed in air.
At a point x metres from it, the force on one coulomb positive
charge is Q/4 πε x2 (Fig. 4.16). Suppose, this one coulomb charge
0
is moved towards Q through a small distance dx. Then, work done is
Q
dW = ×(− dx)
4πε r2 Fig. 4.16

The negative sign is taken because dx is considered along the negative direction of x.
The total work done in bringing this coulomb of positive charge from infinity to any point D
which is d metres from Q is given by

4.14. Potential of a Charged Conducting Sphere
The above formula V = Q/4πε ε d applies only to a charge concentrated at a point. The problem
0 r204 Electrical Technology
of finding potential at a point outside a charged sphere sounds
difficult, because the charge on the sphere is distributed over its
entire surface and so, is not concentrated at a point. But the problem
is easily solved by nothing that the lines of force of a charged sphere,
like A in by noting that the lines of force of a charged sphere, like
A in Fig. 4.17 spread out normally from its surface. If produced
backwards, they meet at the centre of A. Hence for finding the
potentials at points outside the sphere, we can imagine the charge
on the sphere as concentrated at its centre O. If r is the radius of
sphere in metres and Q its charge in coulomb then, potential of its
surface is Q/4π ε r volt and electric intensity is
0
Q/4πε r2. At any other point ‘d’ metres from the centre of the

sphere, the corresponding values are Q/4π ε d and Q/4πε d2
0 0 Fig. 4.17
respectively with d > r as shown in Fig. 4.18 though its starting
point is coincident with that of r. The variations of the potential and electric intensity with distance
for a charged sphere are shown in Fig.4.18.
4.15. Equipotential Surfaces
An equipotential surface is a surface in an electric field such that all points on it are at the same
potential. For example, different spherical surfaces around a
charged sphere are equipotential surfaces. One important property
of an equipotential surface is that the direction of the electric field
strength and flux density is always at right angles to the surface.
Also, electric flux emerges out normal to such a surface. If, it is
not so, then there would be some component of E along the surface
resulting in potential difference between various points lying on
it which is contrary to the definition of an equipotential surface.
Fig. 4.18 Fig. 4.19
4.16. Potential and Electric Intensity Inside a Conducting Sphere
It has been experimentally found that when charge is given to a conducting body say, a sphere
then it resides entirely on its outer surface i.e., within a conducting body whether hollow or solid, the
charge is zero. Hence, (i) flux is zero (ii) field intensity is zero (iii) all points within the conductor are
at the same potential as at its surface (Fig. 4.19).
Example 4.9. Three concentric spheres of radii 4, 6 and 8 cm have charges of + 8, − 6 and + 4
μμC respectively. What are the potentials and field strengths at points, 2, 5, 7 and 10 cm from the
centre.Electrostatics 205
Solution. As shown in Fig. 4.20, let the three spheres be
marked A, B and C. It should be remembered that (i) the field
intensity outside a sphere is the same as that obtained by con-
sidering the charge at its centre (ii) inside the sphere, the field
strength is zero (iii) potential anywhere inside a sphere is the
same as at its surface.
(i) Consider point ‘a’ at a distance of 2 cm from the cen-
tre O. Since it is inside all the spheres, field strength at this
point is zero.

∴ p.d. between two points = 90 − 45 = 45 V
4.17.Potential Gradient
It is defined as the rate of change of potential with distance in the direction of electric force
dV
i.e.
dx
Its unit is volt/metre although volt/cm is generally used in practice. Suppose in an electric field
of strength E, there are two points dx metre apart. The p.d. between them is
dV = E .(− dx) = − E .dx ∴ E = − dV ...(i)
dx
The −−−−−ve sign indicates that the electric field is directed outward, while the potential increases
inward.
Hence, it means that electric intensity at a point is equal to the negative potential gradient at
that point.
4.18. Breakdown Voltage and Dielectric Strength
An insulator or dielectric is a substance within which there are no mobile electrons necessary for
electric conduction. However, when the voltage applied to such an insulator exceeds a certain value,
then it breaks down and allows a heavy electric current (much larger than the usual leakage current)
to flow through it. If the insulator is a solid medium, it gets punctured or cracked.
The disruptive or breakdown voltage of an insulator is the minimum voltage required to break it
down.*
Dielectric strength of an insulator or dielectric medium is given by the maximum potential
difference which a unit thickness of the medium can withstand without breaking down.
In other words, the dielectric strength is given by the potential gradient necessary to cause break-
down of an insulator. Its unit is volt/metre (V/m) although it is usually expressed in kV/mm.
For example, when we say that the dielectric strength of air is 3 kV/mm, then it means that the
maximum p.d. which one mm thickness of air can withstand across it without breaking down is 3 kV
or 3000 volts. If the p.d. exceeds this value, then air insulation breaks down allowing large electric
current to pass through.
Dielectric strength of various insulating materials is very important factor in the design of high-
voltage generators, motors and transformers. Its value depends on the thickness of the insulator,
temperature, moisture, content, shape and several other factors.
For example doubling the thickness of insulation does not double the safe working voltage in a
machine.**
* Flashover is the disruptive discharge which taken places over the surface of an insulator and occurs when
the air surrounding it breaks down. Disruptive conduction is luminous.
** The relation between the breakdown voltage V and the thickness of the dielectric is given approximately by
the relation V = At2/3
where A is a constant depending on the nature of the medium and also on the thickness t. The above
statement is known as Baur’s law.Electrostatics 207
Note. It is obvious that the electric intensity E, potential gradient and dielectric strength are dimensionally
equal.
4.19. Safety Factor of a Dielectric
It is given by the ratio of the dielectric strength of the insulator and the electric field intensity
established in it. If we represent the dielectric strength by E and the actual field intensity by E, then
bd
safety factor k = E /E
bd
For example, for air E = 3 × 106 V/m. If we establish a field intensity of 3 × 105 V/m in it, then,
bd
k = 3 × 106/3 ⋅ 105 = 10.
4.20. Boundary Conditions
There are discontinuities in electric fields at the
boundaries between conductors and dielectrics of different
permittivities. The relationships existing between the
electric field strengths and flux densities at the boundary
are called the boundary conditions.
With reference to Fig. 4.21, first boundary conditions
is that the normal component of flux density is continuous
across a surface.
As shown, the electric flux approaches the boundary
BB at an angle θ and leaves it at θ . D and D are the
1 2 1n 2n
normal components of D and D . According to first

oil with an electric charge of 1.6 × 10-19 C is in equilibrium between the plates so that it neither rises
nor falls. What is the mass of the drop ?
Solution. The electric intensity is equal to the potential gradient between the plates.
g = 6,000/2 = 3,000 volt/cm = 3 × 105 V/m
∴ E = 3 × 105 V/m or N/C
∴ force on drop = E × Q = 3 × 105 × 1.6 × 10 −19 = 4.8 × 10 −14 N

5.1. Capacitor
A capacitor essentially consists of two conducting surfaces separated
by a layer of an insulating medium called dielectric. The conducting sur-
faces may be in the form of either circular (or rectangular) plates or be of
spherical or cylindrical shape. The purpose of a capacitor is to store elec-
trical energy by electrostatic stress in the dielectric (the word ‘condenser’
is a misnomer since a capacitor does not ‘condense’ electricity as such, it
merely stores it).
A parallel-plate capacitor is shown in Fig. 5.1. One plate is joined to
the positive end of the supply and the other to the negative end or is earthed.
It is experimentally found that in the presence of an earthed plate B, plate
A is capable of withholding more charge than when B is not there. When
such a capacitor is put across a battery, there is a momentary flow of
electrons from A to B. As negatively-charged electrons are withdrawn
from A, it becomes positive and as these electrons collect on B, it becomes
negative. Hence, a p.d. is established between plates A and B. The transient Fig. 5.1
flow of electrons gives rise to charging current. The strength of the charging
current is maximum when the two plates are uncharged but it then decreases and finally ceases when
p.d. across the plates becomes slowly and slowly equal and opposite to the battery e.m.f.
5.2. Capacitance
The property of a capacitor to ‘store electricity’ may be called
its capacitance.
As we may measure the capacity of a tank, not by the total
mass or volume of water it can hold, but by the mass in kg of
water required to raise its level by one metre, similarly, the
capacitance of a capacitor is defined as “the amount of charge
required to create a unit p.d. between its plates.”
Suppose we give Q coulomb of charge to one of the two plate
of capacitor and if a p.d. of V volts is established between the two,
then its capacitance is
Q charge
C = = A capacitor stores electricity
V potential differnce
Hence, capacitance is the charge required per unit potential difference.
By definition, the unit of capacitance is coulomb/volt which is also called farad (in honour of
Michael Faraday)
∴ 1 farad = 1 coulomb/volt
One farad is defined as the capacitance of a capacitor which requires a charge of one coulomb
to establish a p.d. of one volt between its plates.
One farad is actually too large for practical purposes. Hence, much smaller units like microfarad
(μF), nanofarad (nF) and micro-microfarad (μμF) or picofarad (pF) are generally employed.
1 μF = 10−9 F; 1 nF = 10−9 F ; 1 μμF or pF = 10−12F
Incidentally, capacitance is that property of a capacitor which delays and change of voltage
across it.
5.3. Capacitance of an Isolated Sphere
Consider a charged sphere of radius r metres having a charge of Q coulomb placed in a mediumCapacitance 215
of relative permittivity ε as shown in Fig. 5.2.
r
It has been proved in Art 4.13 that the free surface potential V
of such a sphere with respect to infinity (in practice, earth) is given by
V = Q ∴ Q = 4 π ε ε r
4πε ε r V 0 r
0 r
By definition, Q/V = capacitance C
∴ = 4 π ε ε r F – in a medium
0 r
= 4 π ε r F – in air
0 Fig. 5.2
Note : It is sometimes felt surprising that an isolated sphere can act as a capacitor because, at first sight, it
appears to have one plate only. The question arises as to which is the second surface. But if we remember that
the surface potential V is with reference to infinity (actually earth) then it is obvious that the other surface is
earth. The capacitance 4 π ε r exists between the surface of the sphere and earth.

5.4. Spherical Capacitor
(a) When outer sphere is earthed
Consider a spherical capacitor consisting of two concentric spheres of radii ‘a’ and ‘b’ metres as
shown in Fig. 5.3. Suppose, the inner sphere is given a charge of + Q
coulombs. It will induce a charge of − Q coulombs on the inner surfaces
which will go to earth. If the dielectric medium between the two spheres
has a relative permittivity of ε , then the free surface potential of the inner
r
sphere due to its own charge Q/4 π ε ε a volts. The potential of the
0 r
inner sphere due to − Q charge on the outer sphere is − Q/4 π ε ε b
0 r
(remembering that potential anywhere inside a sphere is the same as that
its surface).

(b) When inner sphere is earthed
Such a capacitor is shown in Fig. 5.4. If a charge of + Q coulombs is given to the outer sphere A,
it will distribute itself over both its inner and outer surfaces. Some charge Q coulomb will remain on
2
the outer surface of A because it is surrounded by earth all around. Also, some charge
+ Q coulombs will shift to its inner side because there is an earthed sphere B inside A.

Obviously, Q = Q + Q

The inner charge + Q coulomb on A induces − Q coulomb on B but the other induced charge of
1 1
+ Q coulomb goes to earth.

From (ii) and (iii), it is obvious that when a dielectric slab of thickness t and relative permittivity

from (ii), the denominator decreases. The distance between the plates is effectively reduces by
(t − t/ε ). To bring the capacitance back to its original value, the capacitor plates will have to be

5.7. Multiple and Variable Capacitors
Multiple capacitors are shown in Fig. 5.9 and Fig. 5.10.
The arrangement of Fig. 5.9. is equivalent to two capacitors joined in parallel. Hence, its
capacitance is double that of a single capacitor. Similarly, the arrangement of Fig. 5.10 has four times
the capacitance of single capacitor.218 Electrical Technology

If one set of plates is fixed and the other is capable of rotation, then
capacitance of such a multiplate capacitor can be varied. Such variable-
capacitance air capacitors are widely used in radio work (Fig. 5.11). The
set of fixed plates F is insulated from the other set R which can be rotated
by turning the knob K. The common area between the two sets is varied
by rotating K, hence the capacitance between the two is altered. Minimum
capacitance is obtained when R is completely rotated out of F and maximum
when R is completely rotated in i.e. when the two sets of plates completely
overlap each other.
The capacitance of such a capacitor is

capacitance of 10 μ F is varied thus :
The p.d. is increased uniformly from 0 to 600 V in seconds. It
is then maintained constant at 600 V for 1 second and subse-
quently decreased uniformly to zero in five seconds. Plot a
graph showing the variation of current during these 8 sec-

Example 5.3. A capacitor consists of two similar square aluminium plates, each 10 cm × 10 cm

5.8. Cylindrical Capacitor
A single-core cable or cylindrical capacitor consisting two
co-axial cylinders of radii a and b metres, is shown in Fig. 5.14.
Let the charge per metre length of the cable on the outer surface
of the inner cylinder be + Q coulomb and on the inner surface of
the outer cylinder be − Q coulomb. For all practical purposes,
the charge + Q coulomb/metre on the surface of the inner cylin-
der can be supposed to be located along its axis. Let ε be the
r
relative permittivity of the medium between the two cylinders.
The outer cylinder is earthed.
Now, let us find the value of electric intensity at any point
distant x metres from the axis of the inner cylinder. As shown in
Fig. 5.15, consider an imaginary co-axial cylinder of radius x
metres and length one metre between the two given cylinders.
The electric field between the two cylinders is radial as shown.
Total flux coming out radially from the curved surface of this
imaginary cylinder is Q coulomb. Area of the curved surface = 2
π x × 1 = 2 π x m2.
Hence, the value of electric flux density on the surface of the
imaginary cylinder is

5.10. Capacitance Between Two Parallel Wires
This case is of practical importance in overhead trans-
mission lines. The simplest system is 2-wire system (either
d.c. or a.c.). In the case of a.c. system, if the transmission
line is long and voltage high, the charging current drawn by
the line due to the capacitance between conductors is appre-
ciable and affects its performance considerably.
With reference to Fig. 5.16, let

A capictor can be charged by

with a battery of e.m.f. 100 V. The connections
are broken and the like terminals of the capaci-
tors are then joined. Find the final charge on
Fig. 5.19
each capacitor.
Solution. When joined in series, let V and V be the voltages across the capacitors. Then as
1 2
charge across each is the same.
∴ 4 × V = 2V ∴ V = 2V Also V + V = 100
1 2 2 1 1 2
∴ V + 2V = 100 ∴ V = 100/3 V and V = 200/3 V
1 1 1 2
∴ Q = Q = (200/3) × 2 = (400/3) μ C
1 2
∴ Total charge on both capacitors = 800/3 μ C
When joined in parallel, a redistribution of charge takes place because both capacitors are re-
duced to a common potential V.
Total charge = 800/3 μ C; total capacitance = 4 + 2 = 6 μ F
∴ V = 800 = 400 volts

Example 5.16. Two capacitors A and B are connected in series across a 100 V supply and it is
observed that the p.d.s. across them are 60 V and 40 V respectively. A capacitor of 2 μF capacitance
is now connected in parallel with A and the p.d. across B rises to 90 volts. Calculate the capacitance
of A and B in microfarads.
Solution. Let C and C μ F be the capacitances of the two capacitors. Since they are connected

Example 5.17. Three capacitors of 2 μ F, 5 μ F and 10 μ F have breakdown voltage of 200 V,

to the circuit is gradually increased. Which capacitor will breakdown first ? Determine the total
applied voltage and total energy stored at the point of breakdown. [Bombay Univeristy 2001]
Solution. C of 2 μF, C of 5 μ F, and C of 10 μF are connected

1/C = 1/C + 1/C + 1/C , which gives C = 1.25 μ F

Solution. Capacitances are being dealt with in this case. For simplifying this, Delta to star
transformation is necessary. Formulae for this transformation are known if we are dealing with resistors
or impedances. Same formulae are applicable to capacitors provided we are aware that capacitive
reactance is dependent on reciprocal of capacitance.
Further steps are given below :
Fig. 5.24 (b) Fig. 5.24 (c)
Reciprocals of capacitances taken first :
Between B-C ⎯⎯ 0.05, Between B-D ⎯⎯ 0.10
Between C-D ⎯⎯ 0.05, Sum of these three = 0.20
For this delta, star-transformation is done :
Between N-C : 0.05 × 0.05/0.20 = 0.0125, its reciprocal = 80 μ F
Between N-B : 0.05 × 0.10/0.20 = 0.025, its reciprocal = 40 μ F
Between N-D : 0.05 × 0.10/0.20 = 0.025, its reciprocal = 40 μ F
This is marked on Fig. 5.24 (c).
With series-parallel combination of capacitances, further simplification gives the final result.
C = 16.13 μμμμμ F

Note : Alternatively, with ADB as the vertices and C treated as the star point, star to delta transformation
can be done. The results so obtained agree with previous effective capacitance of 16.14 μ F.
Example 5.20. (a) A capacitor of 10 pF is connected to a voltage source of 100 V. If the

Potential gradient in the second case will be twice of earlier value.
Example 5.20 (b). A capacitor 5 μ F charged to 10 V is connected with another capacitor of
10 μ F charged to 50 V, so that the capacitors have one and the same voltage after connection. What
are the possible values of this common voltage ? [Bombay University 2000]
Solution. The clearer procedure is discussed here.
Initial charges held by the capacitors are represented by equivalent voltage sources in Fig. 5.25

Thus, the final voltage across the capacitor is 36.67 volts.
Note : If one of the initial voltages on the capacitors happens to be the opposite to the single equivalent
source voltage in Fig. 5.25 (c) will be 60 volts. Proceeding similarly, with proper care about signs, the final
situation will be the common voltage will be 30 volts.

5.14. Insulation Resistance of a Cable Capacitor
In a cable capacitor, useful current flows along the axis of the core but there is always present
some leakage of current. This leakage is radial i.e. at right angles to the flow of useful current. The
resistance offered to this radial leakage of current is called
insulation resistance of the cable. If cable length is greater,
then leakage is also greater. It means that more current will
leak. In other words, insulation resistance is decreased.
Hence, we find that insulation resistance is inversely
proportional to the cable length. This insulation resistance
is not to be confused with conductor resistance which is
directly proportional to the cable length.
Consider i metre of a single-core cable of inner-radius r
1
and outer radius r (Fig. 5.27). Imagine an annular ring of
2
radius ‘r’ and radial thickness ‘dr’.
If resistivity of insulating material is ρ, then resistance of

(ii) that R depends upon the ratio r /r and NOT on the thickness of insulator itself.

insulation resistance of 300 M Ω respectively are joind (i) in series (ii) in parallel. Find the resultant

Solution. (i) The conductor resistance will add like resistances in series. However, the leakage
resistances will decrease and would be given by the reciprocal relation.
Total conductor resistance = 0.7 + 0.5 = 1.2 Ω

5.15. Energy Stored in a Capacitor
Charging of a capacitor always involves some ex-
penditure of energy by the charging agency. This energy
is stored up in the electrostatic field set up in the dielec-
tric medium. On discharging the capacitor, the field col-
lapses and the stored energy is released.
To begin with, when the capacitor is uncharged, little
work is done in transferring charge from one plate to
another. But further instalments of charge have to be
carried against the repulsive force due to the charge
already collected on the capacitor plates. Let us find the
energy spent in charging a capacitor of capacitance C to
a voltage V.
Suppose at any stage of charging, the p.d. across the
plates is v. By definition, it is equal to the work done in
shifting one coulomb from one plate to another. If ‘dq’
is charge next transferred, the work done is Capacitors on a motherboard
dW = v.dq
Now q = Cv ∴ dq = C.dv ∴ dW = Cv.dv
Total work done in giving V units of potential is

It will be noted that the formula 1 DE is similar to the expression 1 stress × strain which is used for

calculating the mechanical energy stored per unit volume of a body subjected to elastic stress.
Example 5.25. Since a capacitor can store charge just like a lead-acid battery, it can be used at
least theoretically as an electrostatic battery. Calculate the capacitance of 12-V electrostatic battery
which the same capacity as a 40 Ah, 12 V lead-acid battery.
Solution. Capacity of the lead-acid battery = 40 Ah = 40 × 36 As = 144000 Coulomb
Energy stored in the battery = QV = 144000 × 12 = 1.728 × 106 J
Energy stored in an electrostatic battery =

∴ 1×C×122 =1.728×106 ∴ C =2.4×104 F=24kF

Example 5.26. A capacitor-type stored-energy welder is to deliver the same heat to a single
weld as a conventional welder that draws 20 kVA at 0.8 pf for 0.0625 second/weld. If C = 2000 μF,
find the voltage to which it is charged. (Power Electronics, A.M.I.E. Sec B, 1993)
Solution. The energy supplied per weld in a conventional welder is
W = VA × cos φ × time = 20,000 × 0.8 × 0.0625 = 1000 J
Now, energy stored in a capacitor is (1/2) CV2

Total energy = 7.5 × 10 − 4 J ; Loss of energy = (37.5 − 7.5) × 10 − 4 = 3 × 10 −−−−− 2 J
The energy is wasted away as heat in the conductor connecting the two capacitors.
* It is similar to the expression for the energy stored per unit volume of a magnetic field.Capacitance 235
Example 5.28. An air-capacitor of capacitance 0.005 μ F is connected to a direct voltage of
500 V, is disconnected and then immersed in oil with a relative permittivity of 2.5. Find the energy

Solution. Energy before immersion is
E = 1 CV2 = 1×0.005×10 −6×5002 = 625 × 10–6 J
1 2 2
When immersed in oil, its capacitance is increased 2.5 times. Since charge is constant, voltage
must become 2.5 times. Hence, new capacitances is 2.5 × 0.005 = 0.0125 μF and new voltage is
500/2.5 = 200 V.

This represents an increase in the energy of the capacitor. This extra work has been done by the
external supply source because charge has to be given to the capacitor when its capacitance increases,
voltage remaining constant.
(b) When Charge Remains Constant

Hence, there is a decrease in the stored energy. The reason is that charge remaining constant,
when the capacitance is increased, then voltage must fall with a consequent decrease in stored energy

the force of attraction between the two be F newtons. If one of the

5.17. Current-Voltage Relationships in a Capacitor
The charge on a capacitor is given by the expression Q = CV. By differentiating this relation, we
get
i = dQ = d (CV)=C dV
dt dt dt
Following important facts can be deduced from the above relations :
(i) since Q = CV, it means that the voltage across a capacitor is proportional to charge, not the
current.
(ii) a capacitor has the ability to store charge and hence to provide a short of memory.
(iii) a capacitor can have a voltage across it even when there is no current flowing.
(iv) from i = c dV/dt, it is clear that current in the capacitor is present only when voltage on it
changes with time. If dV/dt = 0 i.e. when its voltage is constant or for d.c. voltage, i = 0.
Hence, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit.Capacitance 239
(v) from i = C dV/dt, we have dV/dt = i/C. It shows that for a given value of (charge or dis-
charge) current i, rate of change in voltage is inversely proportional to capacitance. Larger
the value of C, slower the rate of change in capacitive voltage. Also, capacitor voltage
cannot change instantaneously.
(vi) the above equation can be put as dv= i .dt

Integrating the above, we get ∫ dv= 1 ∫ i.dt or dv= 1 ∫t idt

5.18. Charging of a Capacitor
In Fig. 5.29. (a) is shown an arrangement by which a capacitor C may be charged through a high
resistance R from a battery of V volts. The voltage across C can be measured by a suitable voltmeter.
When switch S is connected to terminal (a), C is charged but when it is connected to b, C is short
circuited through R and is thus discharged. As shown in Fig. 5.29. (b), switch S is shifted to a for
charging the capacitor for the battery. The voltage across C does not rise to V instantaneously but
builds up slowly i.e. exponentially and not linearly. Charging current i is maximum at the start i.e.
c
when C is uncharged, then it decreases exponentially and finally ceases when p.d. across capacitor
plates becomes equal and opposite to the battery voltage V. At any instant during charging, let
v = p.d. across C; i = charging current

The applied voltage V is always equal to the sum of :
(i) resistive drop (i R) and (ii) voltage across capacitor (v )

∴ V = i R + v ...(i)

Hence, Eq. (iii) becomes log (V − v ) = +log V

This gives variation with time of voltage across the capacitor plates and is shown in Fig. 5.27.(a)Capacitance 241

Now v = q/C and V = Q/C

Equation (iv) becomes q = Q (1−e −t/λ ) ∴ q=Q(1−e −t/λ ) ...(v)

We find that increase of charge, like growth of potential, follows an exponential law in which the
steady value is reached after infinite time (Fig. 5.30 b). Now, i = dq/dt.

Exponentially rising curves for v and q are shown in Fig. 5.30 (a) and (b) respectively.
c
Fig. 5.30 (c) shows the curve for exponentially decreasing charging current. It should be particularly
noted that i decreases in magnitude only but its direction of flow remains the same i.e. positive.
c
As charging continues, charging current decreases according to equation (vi) as shown in Fig.
5.30 (c). It becomes zero when t = ∞ (though it is almost zero in about 5 time constants). Under
steady-state conditions, the circuit appears only as a capacitor which means it acts as an open-circuit.
Similarly, it can be proved that v decreases from its initial maximum value of V to zero exponentially
as given by the relation v = V e

5.19.Time Constant
(a) Just at the start of charging, p.d. across capacitor is zero, hence from (ii) putting v = 0, we get
c
dv
V = CR c
dt
∴ initial rate of rise of voltage across the capacitor is* = ⎛ ⎜ dv c ⎞ ⎟ = V =V volt/second
⎝ dt ⎠ CR λ
t=0
If this rate of rise were maintained, then time taken to reach voltage V would have been
V + V/CR = CR. This time is known as time constant (λ) of the circuit.
* It can also be found by differentiating Eq. (iv) with respect to time and then putting t = 0.242 Electrical Technology
Hence, time constant of an R-C circuit is defined as the time during which voltage across ca-
pacitor would have reached its maximum value V had it maintained its initial rate of rise.
(b) In equation (iv) if t = λ, then
v =V (1−e −t/λ )=V (1−e −t/λ )=V(1−e −1)=V ⎛ ⎜1− 1 ⎞ ⎟=V ⎛ ⎜1− 1 ⎞ ⎟= 0.632 V
c ⎝ e⎠ ⎝ 2.718⎠
Hence, time constant may be defined as the time during which capacitor voltage actually rises
to 0.632 of its final steady value.
(c) From equaiton (vi), by putting t = λ, we get
i = I e − λ/λ = I e − 1 = I /2.718 ≅ 0.37 I
c 0 0 0 0
Hence, the constant of a circuit is also the time during which the charging current falls to 0.37
of its initial maximum value (or falls by 0.632 of its initial value).
5.20. Discharging of a Capacitor
As shown in Fig. 5.31 (a), when S is shifted to b, C is discharged through R. It will be seen that
the discharging current flows in a direction opposite to that the charging current as shown in Fig.
5.31(b). Hence, if the direction of the charging current is taken positive, then that of the discharging
current will be taken as negative. To begin with, the discharge current is maximum but then decreases
exponentially till it ceases when capacitor is fully discharged.

Fig. 5.31
Since battery is cut of the circuit, therefore, by putting V = 0 in equation (ii) of Art. 5.18, we get

The fall of capacitor potential and its discharging current are shown in Fig. 5.32 (b).
One practical application of the above charging and discharging of a capacitor is found in digitalCapacitance 243
control circuits where a square-wave input is applied across an
R-C circuit as shown in Fig. 5.32 (a). The different waveforms
of the current and voltages are shown in Fig. 5.32 (b), (c), (d),
(e). The sharp voltage pulses of V are used for control
R
circuits.
Example 5.37. Calculate the current in and voltage drop
across each element of the circuit shown in Fig. 5.33 (a) after
switch S has been closed long enough for steady-state
conditions to prevail.
Also, calculate voltage drop across the capacitor and the
discharge current at the instant when S is opened.
Solution. Under steady-state conditions, the capacitor be-
comes fully charged and draws no current. In fact, it acts like
an open circuit with the result that no current flows through the
1-Ω resistor. The steady state current I flows through loop
SS
ABCD only.
Hence, I = 100/(6 + 4) = 10 A

Solution. (a) For this part, please refer to Art. 5.18.
(b) λ = CR = 10 × 10 − 6 × 1 × 106 = 10 s ; q = 0.9 Q
Now, q = Q (1 − e − t/l) ∴ 0.9 Q = Q (1 − e − t/10) or et/10 = 10
∴ 0.1 t log e = log 10 or 0.1 t = 2.3 log 10 = 2.3 or t = 23 s

make the lamp strike (glow) 5 seconds after the switch has been closed.
(Electrotechnics-I.M.S. Univ. Baroda)
Solution. Obviously, the capacitor voltage has to rise 120 V in 5 seconds.
∴ 120 = 200 (1 − e − 5/λ ) or e5/λ = 2.5 or λ = 5.464 second.

(Elect. Engineering, Bombay Univ.)
Solution. (a) As seen from Art. 5.18 (b), 63.2% of charge is received in a time equal to the time
constant of the circuit.

5.21. Transient Relations During Capacitor Charging Cycle
Whenever a circuit goes from one steady-state condition to another steady-state condition, it
passes through a transient state which is of short duration. The first steady-state condition is called
the initial condition and the second steady-state condition is called the final condition. In fact,
transient condition lies in between the initial and final conditions. For example, when switch S in Fig.
5.35 (a) is not connected either to a or b, the RC circuit is in its initial steady state with no current and246 Electrical Technology
hence no voltage drops. When S is shifted to point a, current starts flowing through R and hence,
transient voltages are developed across R and C till they achieve their final steady values. The period
during which current and voltage changes take place is called transient condition.
The moment switch S is shifted to point ‘a’ as shown in Fig. 5.35 (b), a charging current i is set
c
up which starts charging C that is initially uncharged. At the beginning of the transient state, i is
c
maximum because there is no potential across C to oppose the applied voltage V. It has maximum
value = V/R = I . It produces maximum voltage drop across R = i R = I R. Also, initially, v = 0, but
0 c 0 c
as time passes, i decreases gradually so does v but v increases exponentially till it reaches the final

steady value of V. Although V is constant, v and v are variable. However, at any time V = v + v =

It is shown in Fig. 5.35 (c).
It should be clearly understood that a negative rate of change means a decreasing rate of change.
It does not mean that the concerned quantity has reversed its direction.
5.22. Transient Relations During Capacitor Discharging Cycle
As shown in Fig. 5.36 (b), switch S has been shifted to b. Hence, the capacitor undergoes the
discharge cycle. Just before the transient state starts, i = 0, v = 0 and v = V. The moment transient
c R cCapacitance 247
state begins, i has maximum value and decreases exponentially to zero at the end of the transient
c
state. So does v . However, during discharge, all rates of change have polarity opposite to that during
c
charge. For example, dv /dt has a positive rate of change during charging and negative rate of change
c
during discharging.
Fig. 5.36
Also, it should be noted that during discharge, v maintains its original polarity whereas i reverses
c c
its direction of flow. Consequently, during capacitor discharge, v also reverses its direction.

The various rates of change at any time during the discharge transients are as given in Art.

These are represented by the curves of Fig. 5.32.
5.23.Charging and Discharging of a capacitor with Initial Charge
In Art. 5.18, we considered the case when the capacitor was initially uncharged and hence, had
no voltage across it. Let us now consider the case, when the capacitor has an initial potential of V
0
(less than V) which opposes the applied battery voltage V as shown in Fig. 5.37 (a).
As seen from Fig. 5.37 (b), the initial rate of rise of v is now somewhat less than when the
c
capacitor is initially uncharged. Since the capacitor voltage rises from an initial value of v to the
0
final value of V in one time constant, its initial rate of rise is given by
⎛dv ⎞ V −V V −V

The value of the capacitor voltage at any time during the charging cycle is given by
v = (V − V )(1− e − t/λ ) + V

Fig. 5.38
However, as shown in Fig. 5.38 (a), if the initial capacitor voltage is negative with respect to the
battery voltage i.e. the capacitor voltage is series aiding the battery voltage, rate of change of v is
c
steeper than in the previous case. It is so because as shown in Fig. 5.38 (b), in one time period, the
voltage change = V − (− V ) = (V + V ). Hence, the initial rate of change of voltage is given by

Example 5.43. In Fig. 5.39, the capacitor is initially uncharged and the switch S is then closed.
Find the values of I, I , I and the voltage at the point A at the start and finish of the transient state.
1 2Capacitance 249
Solution. At the moment of closing the
switch i.e. at the start of the transient state, the
capacitor acts as a short-circuit. Hence, there
is only a resistance of 2 Ω in the circuit because
1 Ω resistance is shorted out thereby grounding
point A. Hence, I = 0; I = I = 12/2 = 6A.
1 2
Obviously, V = 0 V.
A
At the end of the transient state, the ca-
pacitor acts as an open-circuit. Hence,
I = 0 and I = I = 12/(2 + 1) Fig. 5.39

= 4 A. V = 6 V.

(i) At time, t = 0 + immediately after the switch S is closed ;
(ii) At time, t → ∞ i.e. in the steady state. (Network Analysis AMIE Sec. B Winter 1990)
Solution. (i) In this case the coil acts as an open
circuit, hence i = 0 ; v = 0 and v = 20 V.
2 2 L
Since a capacitor acts as a short circuit i = 20/(5 + 4)
3
= 9 = 20/9 A. Hence, v = (20/9) × 4 = 80/9 V and v = 0.
3 c
(ii) Under steady state conditions, capacitor acts as
an open circuit and coil as a short circuit. Hence, i = 20/
2
(5 + 7) = 20/12 = 5/3 A; v = 7 × 5/3 = 35/3 V; v = 0.

Also i = 0, v = 0 but v = 20 V.

Solution. (a) We will first find the voltage available at terminal 1. As seen the net battery
voltage around the circuit = 40 − 10 = 30 V. Drop across 30 K resistor = 30 × 30/(30 + 60) = 10 V.
Hence, potential of terminal 1 with respect to ground G = 40 − 10 = 30 V. Hence, capacitor will
charge to a maximum voltage of 30 V when in position 1.

Example 5.48. The uncharged capacitor, if it is
initially switched to position 1 of the switch for 2 sec
and then switched to position 2 for the next two sec-
onds. What will be the voltage on the capacitor at
the end of this period ? Sketch the variation of volt-
age across the capacitor.[Bombay University 2001]
Solution. Uncharged capacitor is switched to
position 1 for 2 seconds. It will be charged to 100
volts instantaneously since resistance is not present
in the charging circuit. After 2 seconds, the capacitor
charged to 100 volts will get discharged through R-C
circuit with a time constant of Fig. 5.43
τ = RC = 1500 × 10 −3 = 1.5 sec.
Counting time from instant of switching over to positon 2, the expression for voltage across the
capacitor is V (t) = 100 exp (− t/τ)
After 2 seconds in this position,
v (t) = 100 exp (− 2/1.5) = 26/36 Volts.

rent are defined for each. Find the values of these six qualities at both t = 0 − and t = 0+.

Solution. Current source 4 u (t) means a step function of 4 amp applied at t = 0. Other current
source of 5 amp is operative throughout.
At t = 0–, 5 amp source is operative. This unidirectional constant current establishes a steady
current of 5 amp through 30-ohm resistor and 3-H inductor. Note that positive V means a rise from

6.1. Absolute and Relative Permeabilities of a Medium
The phenomena of magnetism and electromagnetism are dependent upon a certain property of
the medium called its permeability. Every medium is supposed to possess two permeabilities :
(i) absolute permeability (μ) and (ii) relative permeability (μ).
r
For measuring relative permeability, vacuum or free space is chosen as the reference medium. It
is allotted an absolute permeability of μ = 4π × 10 −7 henry/metre. Obviously, relative permeability
0
of vacuum with reference to itself is unity. Hence, for free space,
absolute permeability μ = 4π × 10 −7 H/m
0
relative permeability μ = 1.

Now, take any medium other than vacuum. If its relative permeability, as compared to vacuum is
μ, then its absolute permeability is μ = μ μ H/m.

6.2. Laws of Magnetic Force
Coulomb was the first to determine experimentally the quantitative expression for the magnetic
force between two isolated point poles. It may be noted here that, in view of the fact that magnetic
poles always exist in pairs, it is impossible, in practice, to get an isolated pole. The concept of an
isolated pole is purely theoretical. However, poles of a thin but long magnet may be assumed to be
point poles for all practical purposes (Fig. 6.1). By using a torsion balance, he found that the force
between two magnetic poles placed in a medium is
(i) directly proportional to their pole strengths
(ii) inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and
(iii) inversely proportional to the absolute permeability of the surrounding medium.
Fig. 6.1 Fig. 6.2
For example, if m and m represent the magnetic strength of the two poles (its unit as yet being
1 2
undefined), r the distance between them (Fig. 6.2) and μ the absolute permeability of the surrounding
medium, then the force F is given by
F ∝ m 1 m 2 or F = k m 1 m 2 or → F = km 1 m 2r^ in vector from

Hence, a unit magnetic pole may be defined as that pole which when placed in vacuum at a
distance of one metre from a similar and equal pole repels it with a force of 1/4π μ newtons.**

6.3. Magnetic Field Strength (H)
Magnetic field strength at any point within a magnetic field is numerically equally to the force
experienced by a N-pole of one weber placed at that point. Hence, unit of H is N/Wb.
Suppose, it is required to find the field intensity at a point A distant r metres from a pole of m
webers. Imagine a similar pole of one weber placed at point A. The force experienced by this pole is
m×1 m
F = N ∴ H = N/Wb (or A/m)*** or oersted.

Also, if a pole of m Wb is placed in a uniform field of
strength H N/Wb, then force experienced by the pole is = mH

It should be noted that field strength is a vector quantity
having both magnitude and direction
∴ H → = m r^ = m r

It would be helpful to remember that following terms are
sometimes interchangeably used with field intensity :
Magnetising force, strength of field, magnetic intensity and
intensity of magnetic field.
6.4. Magnetic Potential
The magnetic potential at any point within a mag-
netic field is measured by the work done in shifting a
N-pole of one weber from infinity to that point against
the force of the magnetic field. It is given by

It is a scalar quantity.

6.5. Flux per Unit Pole
A unit N-pole is supposed to radiate out a flux of one weber. Its symbol is Φ. Therefore, the flux
coming out of a N-pole of m weber is given by
Φ = m Wb
* To commemorate the memory of German physicist Wilhelm Edward Weber (1804-1891).
** A unit magnetic pole is also defined as that magnetic pole which when placed at a distance of one metre
from a very long straight conductor carrying a current of one ampere experiences a force of 1/2π newtons
(Art. 6.18).
*** It should be noted that N/Wb is the same thing as ampere/metre (A/m) or just A/m cause ‘turn’ has no units260 Electrical Technology
6.6. Flux Density (B)
It is given by the flux passing per unit area through a plane at right angles to the flux. It is usually
designated by the capital letter B and is measured in weber/meter2. It is a Vector Quantity.
It ΦWb is the total magnetic flux passing normally through an area of A m2, then
B = Φ/AWb/m2 or tesla (T)
Note. Let us find an expression for the flux density at a point distant r metres from a unit N-pole (i.e. a pole
of strength 1 Wb.) Imagine a sphere of radius r metres drawn round the unit pole. The flux of 1 Wb radiated out
by the unit pole falls normally on a surface of 4πr2.m2. Hence
B = Φ = 1 Wb/m2
A 4πr2
6.7. Absolute Permeability (μμμμμ) and Relative Permeability (μμμμμ )
rr
In Fig. 6.3 is shown a bar of a magnetic material, say, iron placed in a uniform field of strength H
N/Wb. Suppose, a flux density of B Wb/m2 is developed in the rod.
Fig. 6.3
Then, the absolute permeability of the material of the rod is defined as
μ = B/H henry/metre or B = μH = µ µ H Wb/m2 ...(i)
0 r
When H is established in air (or vacuum), then corresponding flux density developed in air is
B = µ H
0 0
Now, when iron rod is placed in the field, it gets magnetised by induction. If induced pole
strength in the rod is m Wb, then a flux of m Wb emanates from its N-pole, re-enters its S-pole and
continues from S to N-pole within the magnet. If A is the face or pole area of the magentised iron bar,
the induction flux density in the rod is
B = m/A Wb/m2
i
Hence, total flux density in the iron rod consists of two parts [Fig. 6.3 (b)].
(i) B –flux density in air even when rod is not present
0
(ii) B –induction flux density in the rod
i
B = B + B = µ H + m/A
0 i 0
Eq. (i) above may be written as B = µ . µ H = µ B
r 0 r 0
∴ µ = B = B(material) ...for same H
r B B (vacuum)
0 0
Hence, relative permeability of a material is equal to the ratio of the flux density produced in
that material to the flux density produced in vacuum by the same magnetising force.
6.8. Intensity of Magnetisation (I)
It may be defined as the induced pole strength developed per unit area of the bar. Also, it is the
magnetic moment developed per unit volume of the bar.
Let m = pole strength induced in the bar in WbMagnetism and Electromagnetism 261
A = face or pole area of the bar in m2
Then I = m/A Wb/m2
Hence, it is seen that intensity of magnetisation of a substance may be defined as the flux density
produced in it due to its own induced magnetism.
If l is the magnetic length of the bar, then the product (m × l) is known as its magnetic momentM.
∴ I = m =
m×l
= M = magnetic moment/volume
A A×l V
6.9. Susceptibility (K)
Susceptibility is defined as the ratio of intensity of magnetisation I to the magnetising force H.
∴ K = I/H henry/metre.
6.10. Relation Between B, H, I and K
It is obvious from the above discussion in Art. 6.7 that flux density B in a material is given by
B = B + m/A = B + I ∴ B = μ H + I
0 0 0
Now absolute permeability is µ = B = μ 0 H +I =µ + I ∴ µ = µ + K
H H 0 H 0
Also µ = µ µ ∴ µ µ = µ + K or µ = 1 + K/µ
0 r 0 r 0 r 0
For ferro-magnetic and para-magnetic substances, K is positive and for diamagnetic substances,
it is negative. For ferro-magnetic substance (like iron, nickel, cobalt and alloys like nickel-iron and
cobalt-iron) μ is much greater than unity whereas for para-magnetic substances (like aluminium), µ
r r
is slightly greater than unity. For diamagnetic materials (bismuth) µ < 1.

6.11. Boundary Conditions
The case of boundary conditions between two materials of
different permeabilities is similar to that discussed in Art. 4.19.
As before, the two boundary conditions are

boundary. B = B ...(i)

6.12. Weber and Ewing’s Molecular Theory
This theory was first advanced by Weber in 1852 and was, later on, further
developed by Ewing in 1890. The basic assumption of this theory is that
molecules of all substances are inherently magnets in themselves, each having
Fig. 6.5 a N and S pole. In an unmagnetised state, it is supposed that these small molecular262 Electrical Technology
magnets lie in all sorts of haphazard manner forming
more or less closed loops (Fig. 6.5). According to the
laws of attraction and repulsion, these closed magnetic
circuits are satisfied internally, hence there is no resultant
Fig. 6.6
external magnetism exhibited by the iron bar. But when
such an iron bar is placed in a magnetic field or under the influence of
a magnetising force, then these molecular magnets start turning round
their axes and orientate themselves more or less along straight lines
parallel to the direction of the magnetising force. This linear
arrangement of the molecular magnets results in N polarity at one end
of the bar and S polarity at the other (Fig. 6.6). As the small magnets
turn more nearly in the direction of the magnetising force, it requires
more and more of this force to produce a given turning moment, thus
accounting for the magnetic saturation. On this theory, the hysteresis
loss is supposed to be due to molecular friction of these turning
magnets.
Because of the limited knowledge of molecular structure available
Molecular magnets which are
at the time of Weber, it was not
randomly arranged in the
possible to explain firstly, as to
unmagnetised state, get ori-
why the molecules themselves are ented under the influence of an
magnets and secondly, why it is external magnetizing force
impossible to magnetise certain
substances like wood etc. The first objection was explained by
Ampere who maintained that orbital movement of the electrons
round the atom of a molecule constituted a flow of current which,
due to its associated magnetic effect, made the molecule a magnet.
Later on, it became difficult to explain the phenomenon of
diamagnetism (shown by materials like water, quartz, silver and
An iron nail converts into a magnet copper etc.) erratic behaviour of ferromagnetic (intensely
as soon as the external magnetizing
magnetisable) substances like iron, steel, cobalt, nickel and some
force starts acting on it
of their alloys etc. and the paramagnetic (weakly magnetisable)
substances like oxygen and aluminium etc. Moreover, it was asked : if molecules of all substances are
magnets, then why does not wood or air etc. become magnetised ?
All this has been explained satisfactorily by the atom-domain theory which has superseded the
molecular theory. It is beyond the scope of this book to go into the details of this theory. The
interested reader is advised to refer to some standard book on magnetism. However, it may just be
mentioned that this theory takes into account not only the planetary motion of an electron but its
rotation about its own axis as well. This latter rotation is called ‘electron spin’. The gyroscopic
behaviour of an electron gives rise to a magnetic moment which may be either positive or negative. A
substance is ferromagnetic or diamagnetic accordingly as there is an excess of unbalanced positive
spins or negative spins. Substances like wood or air are non-magnetisable because in their case, the
positive and negative electron spins are equal, hence they cancel each other out.
6.13. Curie Point
As a magnetic material is heated, its molecules vibrate
more violently. As a consequence, individual molecular
magnets get out of alignment as the temperature is increased,
thereby reducing the magnetic strength of the magnetised
substance. Fig. 6.7 shows the approximate decrease of mag-
netic strength with rise in temperature. Obviously, it is pos-
sible to partially or even completely destroy the magnetic
properties of a material by heating. The temperature at which
the vibrations of the molecular magnets become so random
Fig. 6.7Magnetism and Electromagnetism 263
and out of alignment as to reduce the magnetic strength to zero is called Curie point. More accu-
rately, it is that critical temperature above which ferromagnetic material becomes paramagnetic.

6.14 . Force on a Current-carrying Conductor Lying in a Magnetic Field
It is found that whenever a current-carrying conductor is placed in magnetic field, it experiences
a force which acts in a direction perpendicular both to the direction of the current and the field. In
Fig. 6.8 is shown a conductor XY lying at right angles to the uniform horizontal field of flux density B
Wb/m2 produced by two solenoids A and B. If l is the length of the conductor lying within this field
and I ampere the current carried by it, then the magnitude of the force experienced by it is
F = BIl = µ µ HIl newton
→ → → 0 r → →
Using vector notation F = I l ×B and F = IlB sin θ where θ is the angle between l and B which
is 90º in the present case
or F = Il B sin 90º = Il B newtons (∵ sin 90º = 1)
The direction of this force may be easily found by Fleming’s left-hand rule.
Fig. 6.8 Fig. 6.9
Hold out your left hand with forefinger, second finger and thumb at right angles to one another.
If the forefinger represents the direction of the field and
the second finger that of the current, then thumb gives the
direction of the motion. It is illustrated in Fig. 6.9.
Fig. 6.10 shows another method of finding the direc-
tion of force acting on a current carrying conductor. It is
known as Flat Left Hand rule. The force acts in the direc-
tion of the thumb obviously, the direction of motor of the
conductor is the same as that of the force.
It should be noted that no force is exerted on a con-
ductor when it lies parallel to the magnetic field. In gen-
eral, if the conductor lies at an angle θ with the direction
of the field, then B can be resolved into two components,
B cos θ parallel to and B sin θ perpendicular to the con-
ductor. The former produces no effect whereas the latter is
responsible for the motion observed. In that case,
F = BIl sin θ newton, which has been expressed as
cross product of vector above.*

6.15. Ampere’s Work Law or Ampere’s Circuital Law
The law states that m.m.f.* (magnetomotive force corre-
sponding to e.m.f. i.e. electromotive force of electric field) around
a closed path is equal to the current enclosed by the path.
∫ → → →

representing magnetic field strength in dot product with vector
→
d s of the enclosing path S around current I ampere and that is Fig. 6.11
→
why line integral (“) of dot product H .d → s is taken.
Work law is very comprehensive and is applicable to all magnetic fields whatever the shape of
enclosing path e.g. (a) and (b) in Fig. 6.11. Since path c does not enclose the conductor, the m.m.f.
around it is zero.
The above work Law is used for obtaining the value of the magnetomotive force around simple
idealized circuits like (i) a long straight current-carrying conductor and (ii) a long solenoid.
(i) Magnetomotive Force around a Long Straight Conductor
In Fig. 6.12 is shown a straight conductor
which is assumed to extend to infinity in either
direction. Let it carry a current of I amperes
upwards. The magnetic field consists of circular
lines of force having their plane perpendicular to
the conductor and their centres at the centre of the
conductor.
Suppose that the field strength at point C
distant r metres from the centre of the conductor is
H. Then, it means that if a unit N-pole is placed at
C, it will experience a force of H newtons. The
direction of this force would be tangential to the
circular line of force passing through C. If this
unit N-pole is moved once round the conductor
against this force, then work done i.e.

(ii) Magnetic Field Strength of a Long Solenoid
Let the Magnetic Field Strength along the axis of the sole-
noid be H. Let us assume that
(i) the value of H remains constant throughout the length l
of the solenoid and
(ii) the volume of H outside the solenoid is negligible.
Suppose, a unit N-pole is placed at point A outside the sole-
noid and is taken once round the completed path (shown dotted Magnetic field around a coil
carrying electric current
in Fig. 6.14) in a direction opposite to that of H. Remembering
that the force of H newtons acts on the N-pole only
over the length l (it being negligible elsewhere), the
work done in one round is
=H × l joules = Amperes
The ‘ampere-turns’ linked with this path are NI
where N is the number of turns of the solenoid and I

netic Field Strengths at the axial point P due to the op-

angles to the planes containing P and ab and P and cd
respectively. Now, H and H are numerically equal, Fig. 6.17

hence their components at right angles to the axis of the coil will cancel out, but the axial components
will add together. Similarly, the other two sides da and bc will also give a resultant axial component

dH =
4π(r2+ x2)
The direction of dH is at right angles to the line AP join-
ing point P to the element ‘dl’. Now, dH can be resolved into
two components :
(a) the axial component dH′ = dH sin θ
(b) the vertical component dH″ = dH cos θ Fig. 6.19
Now, the vertical component dH cos θ will be cancelled by an equal and opposite vertical com-
ponent of dH due to element ‘dl’ at point B. The same applies to all other diametrically opposite pairs
of dl’s taken around the coil. Hence, the resultant magnetising force at P will be equal to the sum of
all the axial components.268 Electrical Technology

(iv) Magnetising Force on the Axis of a Short Solenoid
Let a short solenoid having a length of l
and radius of turns r be uniformly wound with
N turns each carrying a current of I as shown
in Fig. 6.21. The winding density i.e. num-
ber of turns per unit length of the solenoid is
N/l. Hence, in a small element of length dx,
there will be N.dx/l turns. Obviously, a very
short element of length of the solenoid can
be regarded as a concentrated coil of very
short axial length and having N.dx/l turns. Let
dH be the magnetising force contributed by Fig. 6.21
the element dx at any axial point P. Then, substituting dH for H and N.dx/l for N in Eq. (iii), we get
dH = N.dx . I .sin3θ
l 2r
Now dx . sin θ = r . dθ/sin θ* ∴ dx = r . dθ/sin2 θ
Substituting this value of dx in the above equation, we get
dH = NI sin θ . dθ

Total value of the magnetising force at P due to the whole length of the solenoid may be found by
integrating the above expression between proper limits.

The above expression may be used to find the value of H at any point of the axis, either inside or

Example 6.2. Calculate the magnetising force and flux density at a distance of 5 cm from a

flowing through the wire is 100 A, find the magnetising force at the centre of the square and the

Example 6.4. A current of 15 A is passing along a straight wire. Calculate the force on a unit
magnetic pole placed 0.15 metre from the wire. If the wire is bent to form into a loop, calculate the
diameter of the loop so as to produce the same force at the centre of the coil upon a unit magnetic
pole when carrying a current of 15 A. (Elect. Engg. Calcutta Univ.)
Solution. By the force on a unit magnetic pole is meant the magnetising force H.
For a straight conductor [Art 6.15 (i)] H = I/2 π r = 15/2π × 0.15 = 50/π AT/m
Now, the magnetising force at the centre of a loop of wire is [Art. 6.17 (iii)]

Since the two magnetising forces are equal
∴ 50/π = 15/D; D = 15 π/50 = 0.9426 m = 94.26 cm.

6.18. Force Between Two Parallel Conductors
(i) Currents in the same direction. In Fig.
6.23 are shown two parallel conductors P and Q
carrying currents I and I amperes in the same
1 2
direction i.e. upwards. The field strength in the
space between the two conductors is decreased due
to the two fields there being in opposition to each
other. Hence, the resultant field is as shown in the
figure. Obviously, the two conductors are
attracted towards each other.
(ii) Currents in opposite directions. If, as
shown in Fig. 6.24, the parallel conductors carry
currents in opposite directions, then field strength
is increased in the space between the two conduc-
tors due to the two fields being in the same direc-
tion there. Because of the lateral repulsion of the Fig. 6.23
lines of the force, the two conductors experience a mutual force of repulsion as shown separately in
Fig. 6.24 (b).
6.19. Magnitude of Mutual Force
It is obvious that each of the two parallel conductors lies in the magnetic field of the other
conductor. For example, conductor P lies in the magnetic field of Q and Q lies in the field of P. If ‘d’
metres is the distance between them, then flux density at Q due to P is [Art. 6.15 (i)]
μ I
B = 2 0 πd 1 Wb/m2Magnetism and Electromagnetism 271
If l is the length of conductor Q lying in this
flux density, then force (either of attraction or
repulsion) as given in Art. 6.14 is
μ I I l
F = BI l newton or F = 0 1 2 N
2 2πd
Obviously, conductor P will experience an
equal force in the opposite direction.
The above facts are known as Laws of Paral-
lel Currents and may be stated as follows :
(i) Two parallel conductors attract each other
if currents through them flow in the same
direction and repel each other if the cur-
rents through them flow in the opposite
directions.
(ii) The force between two such parallel con-
Fig. 6.24
ductors is proportional to the product of
current strengths and to the length of the conductors considered and varies inversely as the
distance between them.
6.20. Definition of Ampere
If has been proved in Art. 6.19 above that the force between two infinitely long parallel cur-
rently-carrying conductors is given by the expression
F = μ 0 I 1 I 2 l N or F = 4π×10 −7 I 1 I 2 l =2×10 −7 I 1 I 2 N
2πd 2πd d
The force per metre run of the conductors is
F = 2×10 −7 I 1 I 2 N/m
d
If I = I = 1 ampere (say) and d = 1 metre, then F = 2 × 10 −7 N
1 2
Hence, we can define one ampere current as that current which when flowing in each of the two
infinitely long parallel conductors situated in vacuum and separated 1 metre between centres,
produces on each conductor a force of 2 ××××× 10 −−−−−7 N per metre length.
Example 6.6. Two infinite parallel conductors carry parallel currents of 10 amp. each. Find
the magnitude and direction of the force between the conductors per metre length if the distance
between them is 20 cm. (Elect. Engg. Material - II Punjab Univ. May 1990)
Solution. F = 2 × 10 −7 10×10×1 N = 10 −−−−−4 N
0.2
The direction of force will depend on whether the two currents are flowing in the same direction
or in the opposite direction. As per Art. 6.19, it would be a force of attraction in the first case and that
or repulsion in the second case.
Example 6.7. Two long straight parallel wires, standing in air 2 m apart, carry currents I and
1
I in the same direction. The magnetic intensity at a point midway between the wires is 7.95 AT/m. If
th 2 e force on each wire per unit length is 2.4 × 10 −4 N, evaluate I and I .
1 2
Solution. As seen from Art. 6.17, the magnetic intensity of a long straight current-carrying
conductor is
I
H = AT/m
2πr272 Electrical Technology
Also, it is seen from Fig. 6.23 that when the two currents flow in the same direction, net field
strength midway between the two conductors is the difference of the two field strengths.
Now, H = I /2π and H = I /2π because r = 2/1 = 2 metre
1 1 2 2
I I
∴ 1 − 2 = 7.95 ∴ I − I = 50 ...(i)

Force per unit length of the conductors is F = 2 × 10 −7 I I /d newton
1 2
∴ 2.4 × 10 −4 = 2 × 10 −7 I I /2 ∴ I I = 2400 ...(ii)
1 2 1 2
Substituting the value of I from (i) in (ii), we get
1
(50 + I )I = 2400 or I 2 + 50I − 2400 = 0
2 2 2 2
or (I + 80) (I − 30) = 0 ∴ I = 30 A and I = 50 + 30 = 80 A

MAGNETIC CIRCUIT
6.21. Magnetic Circuit
It may be defined as the route or path which is followed by magnetic flux. The law of magnetic
circuit are quite similar to (but not the same as) those of the electric circuit.
Consider a solenoid or a toroidal iron ring having a magnetic path of l metre, area of cross
section A m2 and a coil of N turns carrying I amperes wound anywhere on it as in Fig. 6.25.
Then, as seen from Art. 6.15, field strength inside the solenoid is

The numerator ‘Nl’ which produces magnetization in the magnetic Fig. 6.25
circuit is known as magnetomotive force (m.m.f.). Obviously, its unit is ampere-turn (AT)*. It is
analogous to e.m.f. in an electric circuit.
The denominator l is called the reluctance of the circuit and is analogous to resistance in

6.22. Definitions Concerning Magnetic Circuit
1. Magnetomotive force (m.m.f.). It drives or tends to drive flux through a magnetic circuit
and corresponds to electromotive force (e.m.f.) in an electric circuit.
M.M.F. is equal to the work done in joules in carrying a unit magnetic pole once through the
entire magnetic circuit. It is measured in ampere-turns.
In fact, as p.d. between any two points is measured by the work done in carrying a unit charge
from one points to another, similarly, m.m.f. between two points is measured by the work done in
joules in carrying a unit magnetic pole from one point to another.
2. Ampere-turns (AT). It is the unit of magnetometre force (m.m.f.) and is given by the
product of number of turns of a magnetic circuit and the current in amperes in those turns.
3. Reluctance. It is the name given to that property of a material which opposes the creation of
magnetic flux in it. It, in fact, measures the opposition offered to the passage of magnetic flux
through a material and is analogous to resistance in an electric circuit even in form. Its units is
AT/Wb.*
reluctance = l = l ; resistance = ρ l = l
μA μ μ A A σA
0 r
In other words, the reluctance of a magnetic circuit is the number of amp-turns required per
weber of magnetic flux in the circuit. Since 1 AT/Wb = 1/henry, the unit of reluctance is “reciprocal
henry.”
4. Permeance. It is reciprocal of reluctance and implies the case or readiness with which
magnetic flux is developed. It is analogous to conductance in electric circuits. It is measured in terms
of Wb/AT or henry.
5. Reluctivity. It is specific reluctance and corresponds to resistivity which is ‘specific
resistance’.
6.23. Composite Series Magnetic Circuit
In Fig. 6.26 is shown a composite series magnetic circuit consisting of three different magnetic
materials of different permeabilities and lengths and one air gap (μ = 1). Each path will have its own
r
reluctance. The total reluctance is the sum of individual reluctances as they are joined in series.

6.24. How to Find Ampere-turns ?
It has been shown in Art. 6.15 that H = NI/l AT/m or NI = H × l
∴ ampere-turns AT = H × l
Hence, following procedure should be adopted for calculating
Fig. 6.26
the total ampere turns of a composite magnetic path.
* From the ratio Φ = m.m.f. , it is obvious that reluctance = m.m.f./Φ. Since m.m.f. is in ampere-
reluctance
turns and flux in webers, unit of reluctance is ampere-turn/weber (AT/Wb) or A/Wb.274 Electrical Technology
(i) Find H for each portion of the composite circuit. For air, H = B/μ , otherwise H = B/μ μ.

(ii) Find ampere-turns for each path separately by using the relation AT = H × l.
(iii) Add up these ampere-turns to get the total ampere-turns for the entire circuit.

DIFFERENCES
1. Strictly speaking, flux does not actually ‘flow’ in the sense in which an electric current flows.
2. If temperature is kept constant, then resistance of an electric circuit is constant and is
independent of the current strength (or current density). On the other hand, the reluctance of a magnetic
circuit does depend on flux (and hence flux density) established in it. It is so because μ (which equals
the slope of B/H curve) is not constant even for a given material as it depends on the flux density B.
Value of μ is large for low value of B and vice-versa. Hence, reluctance is small (S = l/μA) for small
values of B and large for large values of B.
3. Flow of current in an electric circuit involves continuous expenditure of energy but in a
magnetic circuit, energy is needed only creating the flux initially but not for maintaining it.
6.26. Parallel Magnetic Circuits
Fig. 6.29 (a) shown a parallel magnetic circuit consisting of two parallel magnetic paths ACB
and ADB acted upon by the same m.m.f. Each magnetic path has an average length of 2 (l + l ).

The flux produced by the coil wound on the central core is divided equally at point A between the two
outer parallel paths. The reluctance offered by the two parallel paths is = half the reluctance of each
path.

It should be noted that reluctance offered by the central core AB has been neglected in the above
treatment.
6.27. Series-Parallel Magnetic Circuits
Such a circuit is shown in Fig.
6.30 (a). It shows two parallel mag-
netic circuits ACB and ACD con-
nected across the common magnetic
path AB which contains an air-gap
of length l . As usual, the flux Φ in
g
the common core is divided equally
at point A between the two parallel
paths which have equal reluctance.
The reluctance of the path AB con-
sists of (i) air gap reluctance and (ii) Fig. 6.30
the reluctance of the central core which comparatively negligible. Hence, the reluctance of the cen-
tral core AB equals only the air-gap reluctance across which are connected two equal parallel reluc-
tances. Hence, the m.m.f. required for this circuit would be the sum of (i) that required for the air-gap
and (ii) that required for either of two paths (not both) as illustrated in Ex. 6.19, 6.20 and 6.21.
The equivalent electrical circuit is shown in Fig. 6.30 (b) where the total resistance offered to the
voltage source is = R + RæR = R + R/2.

6.28. Leakage Flux and Hopkinson’s Leakage Coefficient
Leakage flux is the flux which follows a path not intended for it. In
Fig. 6.31 is shown an iron ring wound with a coil and having an air-
gap. The flux in the air-gap is known as the useful flux because it is
only this flux which can be utilized for various useful purposes.
It is found that it is impossible to confine all the flux to the iron
path only, although it is usually possible to confine most of the electric
current to a definite path, say a wire, by surrounding it with insulation.
Unfortunately, there is no known insulator for magnetic flux. Air,
which is a splendid insulator of electricity, is unluckily a fairly good
magnetic conductor. Hence, as shown, some of the flux leaks through
air surrounding the iron ring. The presence of leakage flux can be
Fig. 6.31
detected by a compass. Even in the best designed dynamos, it is found276 Electrical Technology
that 15 to 20% of the total flux produced leaks away without being utilised usefully.
If, Φ = total flux produced ; Φ = useful flux available in the air-gap, then
t

usefulflux Φ
In electric machines like motors and generators, magnetic leakage is undesirable, because, al-
though it does not lower their power efficiency, yet it leads to their increased weight and cost of
manufacture. Magnetic leakage can be minimised by placing the exciting coils or windings as close
as possible to the air-gap or to the points in the magnetic circuit where flux is to be utilized for useful
purposes.
It is also seen from Fig. 6.31 that there is fringing or spreading of lines of flux at the edges of the
air-gap. This fringing increases the effective area of the air-gap.
The value of λ for modern electric machines varies between 1.1 and 1.25.
6.29. Magnetisation Curves
The approximate magnetisation curves of a few magnetic materials are shown in Fig. 6.32.
These curves can be determined by the following methods provided the materials are in the
form of a ring :
(a) By means of a ballistic galvanometer and (b) By means of a fluxmeter.
6.30. Magnetisation Curves by Ballistic Galvanometer
In Fig. 6.33 shown the specimen
ring of uniform cross-section wound
uniformly with a coil P which is con-
nected to a battery B through a revers-
ing switch RS, a variable resistance R
1
and an ammeter. Another secondary
coil S also wound over a small portion
of the ring and is connected through a
resistance R to a ballistic galvanometer
BG.
The current through the primary P
can be adjusted with the help of R . Sup-
1
pose the primary current is I. When the
primary current is reversed by means of
RS, then flux is reversed through S,
hence an induced e.m.f. is produced in
it which sends a current through BG.
This current is of very short duration.
The first deflection or ‘throw’ of the BG
is proportional to the quantity of elec-
tricity or charge passing through it so
long as the time taken for this charge to
flow is short as compared with the time

of one oscillation.

6.31. Magnetisation Curves by Fluxmeter
In this method, the BG of Fig. 6.31 is replaced by a fluxmeter which is just a special type of
ballistic galvanometer. When current through P is reversed, the flux is also reversed. The deflection
of the fluxmeter is proportional to the change in flux-linkages of the secondary coil. If the flux is
reversed from + Φ to − Φ, the change in flux-linkages in secondary S in = 2 Φ N .

briefly how the test could be carried out.
In such a test, the primary winding of 400 turns carries a current of 1.8 A. On reversal, a

of 50 laminations, each 0.5 mm thick with outer and inner diameters of 25 and 23 cm respectively.
Assuming uniform flux distribution, determine the values of B, H and the permeability.

Example 6.12. An iron ring has a mean diameter of 0.1 m and a cross-section of 33.5 × 10 −6 m2.
It is wound with a magnetising winding of 320 turns and the secondary winding of 220 turns. On
reversing a current of 10 A in the magnetising winding, a ballistic galvanometer gives a throw of 272
scale divisions, while a Hilbert Magnetic standard with 10 turns and a flux of 2.5 × 10 −4 gives a
reading of 102 scale divisions, other conditions remaining the same. Find the relative permeability

Now, from Hilbert’s Magnetic standard, we have

Determine the current necessary in a coil of 4000 turns wound on section (ii) to produce a flux
density of 0.7 Tesla in the air-gap. Neglect magnetic leakage. (F.E. Pune Univ. May 1990)
Solution. Section (i) It has the same cross-sectional area as the air-gap. Hence, it has the same
flux density i.e. 0.7 Tsela as in the air-gap. The value of the magnetising force H corresponding to
this flux density of 0.7 T as read from the B-H plot is 415 AT/m.
m.m.f. reqd = H × l = 415 × (80 × 10 −3) = 33.2 AT
Section (ii) Since its cross-sectional area is different from that of the air-gap, its flux density
would also be different even though, being a series circuit, its flux would be the same.
Air-gap flux = B × L = 0 × (60 × 10 −6) = 42 × 10 −6 Wb
Flux density in this section = 42 × 10 −6/80 × 10 −6 = 0.525 T
The corresponding value of the H from the given garph is 285 AT/m
m.m.f. reqd, for this section = 285 × (70 × 10 −3) = 19.95 AT.

∴ m.m.f. reqd. = 0.557 × 10 −6 × (0.5 × 10 −3) = 278.5 AT
Total m.m.f. reqd. = 33.2 + 19.95 + 278.5 = 331.6

Example 6.19. A magnetic circuit
made of mild steel is arranged as shown
in Fig. 6.36. The central limb is wound

area of 800 mm2. Each of the outer limbs
has a cross-sectional area of 500 mm2.
The air-gap has a length of 1 mm.
Calculate the current rquired to set up a
flux of 1.3 mWb in the central limb
assuming no magnetic leakage and
fringing. Mild steel required 3800 AT/m
to produce flux density of 1.625 T and 850
AT/m to produce flux density of 1.3 T.
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ. )
Fig. 6.36282 Electrical Technology
Solution. Flux in the central limb is = 1.3 mWb = 1.3 × 10 −3 Wb
Cross section A = 800 mm2 =800 × 10 −6 m2
∴ B = Φ/A = 1.3 × 10 −6 /800 × 10 −6

Corresponding value of H for this flux density is given as 3800 AT/m.
Since the length of the central limb is 120 mm. m.m.f. required is = H × l = 3800 × (120 × 10 −3)
= 456 AT/m.

m.m.f. reqd. for the air-gap = H × l = 0.1293 × 107 × 10 −3 = 1293 AT.
The flux of the central limb divides equally at point A in figure along the two parallel path ABCD
and AFED. We may consider either path, say ABCD and calculate the m.m.f. required for it. The
same m.m.f. will also send the flux through the other parallel path AFED.
Flux through ABCD = 1.3 × 10 −3/2 = 0.65 × 10 −3 Wb
Flux density B = 0.65 × 10 −3/500 × 10 −6 = 1.3 T
The corresponding value of H for this value of B is given at 850 AT/m.
∴ m.m.f. reqd. for path ABCD = H × l = 850 × (300 × 10 −3) = 255 AT
As said above, this, m.m.f. will also send the flux in the parallel path AFED.
Total m.m.f. reqd. = 456 + 1293 + 255 = 2004 AT
Since the number of turns is 500, I = 2004/500 = 4A.

Solution. Two points should be noted
(i) there are two (equal) parallel paths

(ii) flux density in either parallle path is
half of that in the central path because flux
divides into two equal parts at point A.

∴ AT for central limb = 900 × 0.3 = 270

(Elect. Technology, Indore Univ.)
Solution. The magnetic circuit is shown in Fig. 6.39.
The m.m.f. (or AT) produced on the half A acts across the parallel magnetic circuit C and D.
First, total AT across C is calculated and since these amp-turns are also applied across D, the flux
density B in D can be estimated. Next, flux density in A is calculated and therefore, the AT required
for this flux density. In fact, the total AT (or m.m.f.) required is the sum of that required for A and that
of either for the two parallel paths C or D.
Value of flux density in C = 1.0 Wb/m2
Mean diameter of the ring = (24 + 18)/2 = 21 cm284 Electrical Technology
Mean circumference = π × 21 = 66 cm
Length of path A or C = 66/2 = 33 cm = 0.33 m
Value of AT/m for a flux density of 1.0
Wb/m2 as seen from the given B.H characteristics
= 900 AT/m
∴ Total AT for path C = 900 × 0.33 = 297. The same
ATs. are applied across path D.
Length of path D = 18 cm = 0.18 m ∴ AT/m for
path D = 297/0.18 = 1650
Value of B corresponding to this AT/m from given table Fig. 6.39
is = 1.45 Wb/m2
Flux through C = B × A = 1.0 × 9 × 10 −4 = 9 × 10 −4 Wb
Flux through D = 1.45 × (3 × 0.4 × 10 −4) = 1.74 × 10 −4 Wb
∴ Total flux through A = 9 × 10 −4 + 1.74 × 10 −4 = 10.74 × 10 −4 Wb.
Flux density through A = 10.74 × 10 −4/9 × 10 −4 = 1.193 Wb/m2
No. of AT/m reqd. to produce this flux density as read from the given table = 1200 (approx.)
∴ Amp-turns required for limb A = 1200 × 0.33 = 396
Total AT required = 396 + 297 = 693

Note : Due to the high permeability of iron, which is given here as 2400, 1 mm of air-gap length is
equivalent magnetically to 2400 mm of length through the core, for comparison of mmf required.
Example 6.27. An iron-ring of mean length 30 cm is made up of 3 pieces of cast-iron. Each
piece has the same length, but their respective diameters are 4, 3 and 2.5 cm. An air-gap of length
0.5 mm is cut in the 2.5 – cm. Piece. If a coil of 1000 turns is wound on the ring, find the value of the
current has to carry to produce a flux density of 0.5 Wb/m2 in the air gap. B-H curve data of cast-
iron is as follows :
B (Wb/m2) : 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60
H (AT/m) : 280 680 990 1400 2000 2800

Solution. From the data given, plot the B-H curve for cast-iron
The magnetic circuit has four parts connected in series
Part 1. Air-gap 0.5 mm length, B = 0.5 wb/m2, and
Permeability of free sapce is known
H = B/μ = 0.5 × 107/(4π) = 398100
1 0
AT for gap = (0.5 × 10 −3) × H = 199

Part 2. 2.5 cm diameter, 10 – cm long, cast-iron ring portion B and H are to be related with the
help of given data. In this, out of 10 cms. 0.5 mm air-gap is cut, and this portion of ring will have cast-
iron length of 99.5 mm.
For B = 0.5 wb/m2, H = 2000 AT/m

AT = 2000 × 9.95 × 10 −2 = 199

Part 3. 3-cm diameter, 10-cm long, cast-iron ring-portion.
Here B = 0.50 × (2.5/3)2 = 0.347 Wb/m2
For this B, H is read from B-H curve.
H = 1183 AT/m

AT = 1183 × 10 × 10 −2 = 118.3

Part 4. 4 cm. Diameter, 10 cm long, cast-iron ring portion.
Here, B = 0.50 × (2.5 × 4)2 × 0.195 Wb/m2
From, B–H curve, corresponding H is 661
AT = 661 × 10 × 10 −2 = 66 AT

Since all these four parts in series, the total m.m.f. required is obtained by adding the above terms.
AT = 199 + 199 + 118 + 66 = 582
Coil Current = 582/1000 = 0.582 amp
Additional observations.
(a) The 2.5-cm diameter portion of the ring has H = 2000 for B = 0.5 Wb/m2. From this, the
relative permeability of cast-iron can be foud out.
μ μ = 0.5/2000, giving μ = 199
0 r r
An air-gap of 0.5 mm is equivalent of 99.5 mm of cast-iron length. Hence, the two m.m.fs. are
equal to 199 each.
(b) The common flux for this circuit is obtained from flux-density and the concerned area.
Hence φ = 0.5 × (π/4) × (2.5 × 10 −2)2 = 0.02453 × 10 −2
= 0.2453 mWb
Reluctance of total magnetic circuit

Example 6.28. A steel-ring of 25 cm mean diameter and of circular section 3 cm in diameter
has an air-gap of 1.5 mm length. It is wound uniformly with 700 turns of wire carrying a current of
2 amp. Calculate : (i) Magneto motive force (ii) Flux density (iii) Magnetic flux (iv) Relative perme-
ability. Neglect magnetic leakage and assume that iron path takes 35 % of total magneto motive
force. [Nagpur University, April 1996]288 Electrical Technology
Solution. From the given data, length of mean path in the ring (= L ) is to be calculated. For a
m
mean diameter of 25 cm, with 1.5 mm of air-gap length.
L = (π × 0.25) − (1.5 × 10 −3) = 0.7835 m
m
Cross-sectional area of a 3 cm diameter ring = 7.065 × 10 −4 sq.m.
Total m.m.f. due to coil = 700 × 2 = 1400 amp-turns
Since iron-path takes 355 of the total mmf, it is 490.
Remaining mmf of 910 is consumed by the air-gap.
Corresponding H for air-gap = 910/(1.5 × 10 −3) = 606666 amp-turns/m.
If Flux density is B , we have
g
B = μ H = 4π × 10 −7 × 606666 = 0.762 Wb/m2
g 0 g
Iron-ring and air-gap are in series hence their flux is same. Since the two have some cross-
sectional area, the flux density is also same. The ring has a mean length of 0.7835 m and needs an
mmf of 490. For the ring.
H = 490/0.7845 = 625.4 amp-turns / m
μ μ = B/H = 0.752/625.4 = 1.218 × 10 −3
0 r
μ = (1.218 × 10 −3) / (4 π × 10 −7) = 970
r
Flux = Flux density × Cross-sectional area = 0.762 × 7.065 × 10 −4 = 0.538 milli-webers
Check. µ of 970 means that 1.5 mm of air-gap length is equivalent to (1.5 × 10 −3 × 970) = 1.455
r
m of length through iron as a medium. With this equivalent.
mmf of ring = 0.785 =0.35
mmf for(ring+air-gap)
0.785+1.455
which means that 35 % of total mmf is required for the ring
Example 6.29. (a) Determine the amp-turns required to produce a flux of 0.38 mWb in an iron-
ring of mean diameter 58 cm and cross-sectional area of 3 sq. cm. Use the following data for the
ring :
B Wb/m2 0.5 1.0 1.2 1.4
μ 2500 2000 1500 1000
r
(b) If a saw-cut of 1mm width is made in the ring, calculate the flux density in the ring, with the
mmf remaining same as in (a) above. [Nagpur University, Nov. 1996]
Solution. Plot the B- μ curve as in Fig. 6.42
r
Fig. 6.42Magnetism and Electromagnetism 289
(a) Cross-sectional area = 3 sq. cm = 3 × 10 −4 sq. m.
Flux = 38 mWb = 0.38 × 10 −3 Wb
Flux density, B = flux/area = (0.38 × 10 −3)/(3 × 10 −4) = 1.267 Wb/m2
Looking into the table relating B and μ, interpolation is required for evaluating µ for B = 1.267
r r
Wb/m2. After 1.2 Wb/m2, μ decreases by 500 for a rise of 0.2 in B. Interpolation results into :
r
μ = 1500− 0.067×500=1332
r 0.20
For mean diameter of path in the ring as 0.58 m, the length of the magnetic path in the ring is
l = p × 0.58 = 1.8212 m
m
Since B = μ μ H,
0 r
H = 1.267/(4π × 10 −7 × 1332) = 757
Hence, the required m.m.f. is
757 × 1.8212 = 1378 amp-turns
(b) If a saw-cut of 1 mm is cut in the ring, B is to be calculated with a m.m.f. of 1378. Now the
magnetic circuit has two components in series : the ring with its B-μ curve in Fig. 6.42 and the air-
r
gap. Since B is not known, µ cannot be accurately known right in the initial steps. The procedure to
r
solve the case should be as follows :
Let B the flux density as a result of 1378 amp-turns due to the coil.
For air-gap. H = B / (4π × 10 −7) = 0.796 × 106 AT/m
g g
AT = H × I = 0.796 × 106 × 1 × 10 −3 × B = 796 B
g g g g g
Due to the air-gap, the flux-density is expected to be between 0.5 and 1 Wb/m2, because, in (a)
above, μ (for B = 1.267 Wb/m2) is 1332. One mm air-gap is equivalent to 1332 mm of path added
r
in iron-medium. This proportional increase in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit indicates that
flux density should fall to a value in between 0.5 and 1 Wb/m2.
For Iron-ring. With flux density expected to be as mentioned above, interpolation formula for
μ can be written as :
r
μ = 2500 − 500 [(B − 0.50) / 0.50] = 3000 − 1000 B
r g g
H = B / (μ μ) = B / [μ (3000 − 1000 B )]
i g 0 r g 0 g
Total m.m.f. = AT + AT = 1378, as previously calculated
g i
1.8212×B
Hence, 1378 = g +796B
μ (3000−1000B ) g
0 g
This is a quadratic equation in B and the solution, which gives B in between 0.5 & 1.0 Wb/m2
g g
is acceptable.
This results into B = 0.925 Wb/m2
g
Corresponding μ = 3000 − 1000 × 0.925 = 2075

Example 6.30. An iron-ring of mean diameter 19.1 cm and having a cross-sectional area of
4 sq. cm is required to produce a flux of 0.44 mWb. Find the coil-mmf required.

m290 Electrical Technology
Cross-sectional area = 4 sq.cm = 4 × 10 −4 m2
Flux, φ = 0.44 mWb = 0.44 × 10 −3 Wb
Flux density, B = 0.44 × 10 −3/(4 × 10 −4) = 1.1 Wb/m2
For this flux density, μ = 1800, by simple interpolation.
r
H = B/(μ μ) = 1.1 × 107/(4π × 1800) = 486.5 amp-turns/m.
o r
m.m.f required = H × l = 486.5 × 0.60 = 292

A saw-cut of 1 mm, will need extra mmf.
H = B /μ = 1.1 × 107/(4π) = 875796

Thus, additional mmf required due to air-gap = 876 amp-turns
Example 6.31. A 680-turn coil is wound on the central limb of a cast steel frame as shown in
Fig. 6.43 (a) with all dimensions in cms. A total flux of 1.6 mWb is required in the air-gap. Find the

The yokes are working at a flux-density of 0.50 Wb/m2. From the given data and the correspond-

Fig. 6.44
Solution. Area of cross-section of side-limbs = 2 × 3 = 6 sq.cm
Area of cross-section of core = 3 × 4 = 12 sq.cm
Flux in side Limbs = 0.24 mWb
Flux density in side Limbs = (0.24 × 10 −3)/(6 × 10 −4) = 0.4 Wb/m2
Since the coil is wound on the central limb and the magnetic circuit is symmetrical, the flux in the
central limb = 0.48 mWb. Flux density in the central limb = (0.48 × 10 −3)/(12 × 10 −4) = 0.4 Wb/m2
For the flux density of 0.40 Wb/m2, H = 200 AT/m292 Electrical Technology
Central Limb has a path length of 15 cm.
Other part carrying 0.24 mWb has a total path length of 35 cm.
Total mmf required = (200 × 0.15) + (200 × 0.35) = 100 AT
Hence, coil current = 100/1000 = 0.1 Amp.

7.1. Relation Between Magnetism and Electricity
It is well known that whenever an electric current flows through a conductor, a magnetic field is
immediately brought into existence in the space surrounding the conductor. It can be said that when
electrons are in motion, they produce a magnetic field. The converse of this is also true i.e. when a
magnetic field embracing a conductor moves relative to the conductor, it produces a flow of electrons
in the conductor. This phenomenon whereby an e.m.f. and hence current (i.e. flow of electrons) is
induced in any conductor which is cut across or is cut by a magnetic flux is known as electromagnetic
induction. The historical background of this phenomenon is this :
After the discovery (by Oersted) that electric current produces a magnetic field, scientists began
to search for the converse phenomenon from about 1821 onwards. The problem they put to them-
selves was how to ‘convert’ magnetism into electricity. It is recorded that Michael Faraday* was in
the habit of walking about with magnets in his pockets so as to constantly remind him of the problem.
After nine years of continuous research and experimentation, he succeeded in producing electricity
by ‘converting magnetism’. In 1831, he formulated basic laws underlying the phenomenon of elec-
tromagnetic induction (known after his name), upon which is based the operation of most of the
commercial apparatus like motors, generators and transformers etc.
7.2. Production of Induced E.M.F. and Current
In Fig. 7.1 is shown an insulated coil whose terminals are connected to a sensitive galvanometer
G. It is placed close to a stationary bar magnet initially at position AB (shown dotted). As seen, some
flux from the N-pole of the magnet is linked with or threads through the coil but, as yet, there is no
deflection of the galvanometer. Now, suppose that the magnet is suddenly brought closer to the coil in
position CD (see figure). Then, it is found that there is a jerk or a sudden but a momentary deflection
Fig. 7.1. Fig. 7.2.
in the galvanometer and that this lasts so long as the magnet is in motion relative to the coil, not
otherwise. The deflection is reduced to zero when the magnet becomes again stationary at its new
position CD. It should be noted that due to the approach of the magnet, flux linked with the coil is
increased.
Next, the magnet is suddenly withdrawn away from the coil as in Fig. 7.2. It is found that again
there is a momentary deflection in the galvanometer and it persists so long as the magnet is in
motion, not when it becomes stationary. It is important to note that this deflection is in a direction
opposite to that of Fig. 7.1. Obviously, due to the withdrawal of the magnet, flux linked with the coil
is decreased.
The deflection of the galvanometer indicates the production of e.m.f. in the coil. The only cause
of the production can be the sudden approach or withdrawal of the magnet from the coil. It is found
that the actual cause of this e.m.f. is the change of flux linking with the coil. This e.m.f. exists so long
as the change in flux exists. Stationary flux, however strong, will never induce any e.m.f. in a station-
ary conductor. In fact, the same results can be obtained by keeping the bar magnet stationary and
moving the coil suddenly away or towards the magnet.
* Michael Faraday (1791-1867), an English physicist and chemist.Electromagnetic Induction 299
The direction of this electromagnetically-
induced e.m.f. is as shown in the two figures given
on back page.
The production of this electromagnetically-
induced e.m.f. is further illustrated by considering
a conductor AB lying within a magnetic field and
connected to a galvanometer as shown in Fig. 7.3.
It is found that whenever this conductor is moved
up or down, a momentary deflection is produced
in the galvanometer. It means that some transient Fig. 7.3
e.m.f. is induced in AB. The magnitude of this
induced e.m.f. (and hence the amount of deflection in the galvanometer) depends on the quickness of
the movement of AB.
From this experiment we conclude that whenever a conductor cuts or shears the magnetic flux,
an e.m.f. is always induced in it.
It is also found that if the conductor is moved parallel to the direction of the flux so that it does
not cut it, then no e.m.f. is induced in it.
7.3. Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction
Faraday summed up the above facts into two laws known as Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic
Induction.
First Law. It states :
Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes, an e.m.f. is always induced in it.
or
Whenever a conductor cuts magnetic flux, an e.m.f. is induced in that conductor.
Second Law. It states :
The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is equal to the rate of change of flux-linkages.
Explanation. Suppose a coil has N turns and flux through it changes from an initial value of Φ
1
webers to the final value of Φ webers in time t seconds. Then, remembering that by flux-linkages
2
mean the product of number of turns and the flux linked with the coil, we have
Initial flux linkages = NΦ, add Final flux linkages = NΦ
1 2
NΦ −NΦ Φ −Φ
∴ induced e.m.f. e = 2 1 Wb/s or volt or e = N 2 1 volt
t t
Putting the above expression in its differential form, we get
e = d (N Φ) = N d volt
dt dt
Usually, a minus sign is given to the right-hand side expression to signify the fact that the induced
e.m.f. sets up current in such a direction that magnetic effect produced by it opposes the very cause
producing it (Art. 7.5).
d Φ
e = −N volt
dt
Example 7.1. The field coils of a 6-pole d.c. generator each having 500 turns, are connected in
series. When the field is excited, there is a magnetic flux of 0.02 Wb/pole. If the field circuit is
opened in 0.02 second and residual magnetism is 0.002 Wb/pole, calculate the average voltage
which is induced across the field terminals. In which direction is this voltage directed relative to the
direction of the current.
Solution. Total number of turns, N = 6 × 500 = 3000
Total initial flux = 6 × 0.02 = 0.12 Wb
Total residual flux = 6 × 0.002 = 0.012 Wb
Change in flux, dΦ = 0.12 − 0.012 = 0.108 Wb300 Electrical Technology
Time of opening the circuit, dt = 0.02 second
∴ Induced e.m.f. = N
d Φ volt=3000×0.108
= 16,200 V
dt 0.02
The direction of this induced e.m.f. is the same as the initial direction of the exciting current.
Example 7.2. A coil of resistance 100 Ω is placed in a magnetic field of 1 mWb. The coil has
100 turns and a galvanometer of 400 Ω resistance is connected in series with it. Find the average
e.m.f. and the current if the coil is moved in 1/10th second from the given field to a field of 0.2 mWb.
d Φ
Solution. Induced e.m.f. = N. volt
dt
Here d Φ = 1 − 0.2 = 0.8 mWb = 0.8 × 10 −3 Wb
dt = 1/10 = 0.1 second ; N = 100
e = 100 × 0.8 × 10 −3/0.1 = 0.8 V
Total circuit resistance = 100 + 400 = 500 Ω
∴ Current induced = 0.8/500 = 1.6 × 10 −3 A = 1.6 mA
Example 7.3. The time variation of the flux linked with a coil of 500 turns during a complete
cycle is as follows :
Φ = 0.04 (1 − 4 t/T) Weber 0 < t < T/2
Φ = 0.04 (4t/T − 3) Weber T/2 < t < T
where T represents time period and equals 0.04 second. Sketch the waveforms of the flux and in-
duced e.m.f. and also determine the maximum value of the induced e.m.f..
Fig. 7.4.
Solution. The variation of flux is linear as seen from the following table.
t (second) : 0 T/4 T/2 3T/4 T
F (Weber) : 0.04 0 − 0.04 0 0.04
The induced e.m.f. is given by e = − Nd Φ/dt
From t = 0 to t = T/2, dΦ/dt = − 0.04 × 4/T = − 4 Wb/s ∴ e = − 500 (− 4) = 2000 V
From t = T/2 to t = T, dΦ/dt = 0.04 × 4/T = 4 Wb/s ∴ e = − 500 × 4 = − 2000 V.
The waveforms are selected in Fig. 7.4.
7.4. Direction of induced e.m.f. and currents
There exists a definite relation between the direction of the induced current, the direction of the
flux and the direction of motion of the conductor. The direction of the induced current may be found
easily by applying either Fleming’s Right-hand Rule or Flat-hand rule or Lenz’s Law. Fleming’s ruleElectromagnetic Induction 301
(Fig. 7.5) is used where induced e.m.f. is due to flux-cutting (i.e., dynamically induced e.m.f.) and
Lenz’s when it is used to change by flux-linkages (i.e., statically induced e.m.f.).
Fig. 7.5. Fig. 7.6.
Fig. 7.6 shows another way of finding the direction of the induced e.m.f. It is known as Right
Flat-hand rule. Here, the front side of the hand is held perpendicular to the incident flux with the
thumb pointing in the direction of the motion of the conductor. The direction of the fingers give the
direction of the induced e.m.f. and current.
7.5. Lenz’s Law
The direction of the induced current may also be found by this law which was formulated by
Lenz* in 1835. This law states, in effect, that electromagnetically induced current always flows in
such direction that the action of the magnetic field set up by it tends to oppose the very cause which
produces it.
This statement will be clarified with reference to Fig. 7.1 and 7.2. It is found that when N-pole
of the bar magnet approaches the coil, the induced current set up by induced e.m.f. flows in the anti-
clockwise direction in the coil as seen from the magnet side. The result is that face of the coil
becomes a N-pole and so tends to oppose the onward approach of the N-Pole of the magnet (like
poles repel each other). The mechanical energy spent in overcoming this repulsive force is converted
into electrical energy which appears in the coil.
When the magnet is withdrawn as in Fig. 7.2, the induced current flows in the clockwise direc-
tion thus making the face of the coil (facing the magnet) a S-pole. Therefore, the N-pole of the magnet
has to withdrawn against this attractive force of the S-pole of coil. Again, the mechanical energy
required to overcome this force of attraction is converted into electric energy.
It can be shown that Lenz’s law is a direct consequence of Law of Conservation of Energy.
Imagine for a moment that when N-pole of the magnet (Fig. 7.1) approaches the coil, induced current
flows in such a direction as to make the coil face a S-pole. Then, due to inherent attraction between
unlike poles, the magnet would be automatically pulled towards the coil without the expenditure of
any mechanical energy. It means that we would be able to create electric energy out of nothing, which
is denied by the inviolable Law of Conservation of Energy. In fact, to maintain the sanctity of this law,
it is imperative for the induced current to flow in such a direction that the magnetic effect produced by
it tends to oppose the very cause which produces it. In the present case, it is relative motion of the
magnet with magnet with respect to the coil which is the cause of the production of the induced
current. Hence, the induced current always flows in such a direction to oppose this relative motion
i.e., the approach or withdrawal of the magnet.

7.6. Induced e.m.f. windmill

coil
Induced e.m.f. can be either (i) dynamically induced or (ii) stati-
cally induced. In the first case, usually the field is stationary and conduc- Coil
tors cut across it (as in d.c. generators). But in the second case, usually the
conductors or the coil remains stationary and flux linked with it is changed
by simply increasing or decreasing the current producing this flux (as in
transformers). Brushes
7.7. Dynamically induced e.m.f. Direction of
movement
Magnets
In Fig. 7.7. a conductor A is shown in cross-section, lying m2 within a Elect L ri a c m c p urrent
uniform magnetic field of flux density B Wb/m2. The arrow attached to A The principle of electric
shows its direction of motion. Consider the conditions shown in Fig. 7.7 generation
(a) when A cuts across at right angles to the flux. Suppose ‘l’ is its length lying within the field and let
it move a distance dx in time dt. Then area swept by it is = ldx. Hence, flux cut = l.dx × B webers.
Change in flux = Bldx weber
Time taken = dt second
Hence, according to Faraday’s Laws (Art. 7.3.) the e.m.f. induced in it (known as dynamically
induced e.m.f.) is
rate of change of flux linkages =
Bldx =Bl dx
= Blv volt where
dx
= velocity
dt dt dt
If the conductor A moves at an angle θ with the
direction of flux [Fig. 7.7 (b)] then the induced e.m.f.
is e = Bl υ sin θ volts = lυ×B (i.e. as cross product
vector υ and B).
The direction of the induced e.m.f. is given by
Fleming’s Right-hand rule (Art. 7.5) or Flat-hand rule
and most easily by vector cross product given above.
It should be noted that generators work on the
production of dynamically induced e.m.f. in the con-
ductors housed in a revolving armature lying within
a strong magnetic field. Fig. 7.7
Example 7.4. A conductor of length 1 metre moves at right angles to a uniform magnetic field
of flux density 1.5 Wb/m2 with a velocity of 50 metre/second. Calculate the e.m.f. induced in it. Find
also the value of induced e.m.f. when the conductor moves at an angle of 30º to the direction of the
field.
Solution. Here B = 1.5 Wb/m2 l = 1 m υ = 50 m/s ; e = ?
Now e = Blυ = 1.5 × 1 × 50 = 75 V.
In the second case θ = 30º ∴ sin 30º = 0.5 ∴e = 75 × 0.5 = 37.5 V
Example 7.5. A square coil of 10 cm side and with 100 turns is rotated at a uniform speed of
500 rpm about an axis at right angle to a uniform field of 0.5 Wb/m2. Calculate the instantaneous
value of induced e.m.f. when the plane of the coil is (i) at right angle to the plane of the field. (ii) in
the plane of the field. (iii) at 45º with the field direction. (Elect. Engg. A.M.Ae. S.I. Dec. 1991)
Solution. As seen from Art. 12.2, e.m.f. induced in the coil would be zero when its plane is at right
angles to the plane of the field, even though it will have maximum flux linked with it. However, the coil
will have maximum e.m.f. induced in it when its plane lies parallel to the plane of the field even though
it will have minimum flux linked with it. In general, the value of the induced e.m.f. is given by e = ω NΦ
m
sin θ = E sin θ where θ is the angle between the axis of zero e.m.f. and the plane of the coil.
Here m , f = 500/ 60 = 25/ 3 r.p.s ; N = 100 ; B = 0.5 Wb/ m2 ; A = (10 × 10) × 10 −4 = 10 −2 m2.
∴ E = 2 π f NBA = 2 π (25/3) × 100 × 0.5 × 10 −2 = 26.2 V (i) since θ = 0 ; sin θ = 0 ; therefore,

e = 0. (ii) Here, θ = 90° ; e = E sin 90º = 26.2 × 1 = 26.2 V (iii) sin 45º = 1/ 2 ; e = 26.2 × 1/ 2

Example 7.6. A conducting rod AB (Fig. 7.8) makes contact with metal rails AD and BC which
are 50 cm apart in a uniform magnetic field of B = 1.0 Wb/m2 perpendicular to the plane ABCD. The
total resistance (assumed constant) of the circuit ABCD is 0.4 Ω.
(a) What is the direction and magnitude of the e.m.f. induced in the rod when it is moved to the
left with a velocity of 8 m/s ?
(b) What force is required to keep the rod in motion ?
(c) Compare the rate at which mechanical work is done by the force F with the rate of develop-
ment of electric power in the circuit.
Solution. (a) Since AB moves to the left, direction
of the induced current, as found by applying Fleming’s
Right-hand rule is from A to B. Magnitude of the in-
duced e.m.f. is given by
e = βlυ volt = 1 × 0.5 × 8 = 4 volt
(b) Current through AB = 4/0.4 = 10 A
Force on AB i.e. F = BIl = 1 × 10 × 0.5 = 5 N
The direction of this force, as found by applying
Fig. 7.8
Fleming’s left-hand rule, is to the right.
(c) Rate of doing mechanical work = F × υ = 5 × 8 = 40 J/s or W
Electric power produced = e i = 4 × 10 = 40 W
From the above, it is obvious that the mechanical work done in moving the conductor against
force F is converted into electric energy.
Example 7.7 In a 4-pole dynamo, the flux/pole is 15 mWb. Calculate the average e.m.f. induced
in one of the armature conductors, if armature is driven at 600 r.p.m.
Solution. It should be noted that each time the conductor passes under a pole (whether N or S)
it cuts a flux of 15 mWb. Hence, the flux cut in one revolution is 15 × 4 = 60 mWb. Since conductor
is rotating at 600/60 = 10 r.p.s. time taken for one revolution is 1/10 = 0.1 second.
∴ average e.m.f. generated = N

is established by closing the switch, its magnetic
field is set up which partly links with or threads
through the coil B. As current through A is changed,
the flux linked with B is also changed. Hence,
mutually induced e.m.f. is produced in B whose
magnitude is given by Faraday’s Laws (Art. 7.3)
Fig. 7.10
and direction by Lenz’s Law (Art. 7.5).
If, now, battery is connected to B and the voltmeter across A (Fig. 7.10), then the situation is
reversed and now a change of current in B will produce mutually-induced e.m.f. in A.
It is obvious that in the examples considered above, there is no movement of any conductor, the
flux variations being brought about by variations in current strength only. Such an e.m.f. induced in
one coil by the influence of the other coil is called (statically but) mutually induced e.m.f.
(b) Self-induced e.m.f. This is the e.m.f. induced in a coil due to the change of its own flux
linked with it. If current through the coil (Fig. 7.11) is changed, then the flux linked with its own turns
will also change, which will produce in it what is called
self-induced e.m.f. The direction of this induced e.m.f.
(as given by Lenz’s law) would be such as to oppose
any change of flux which is, in fact, the very cause of
its production. Hence, it is also known as the oppos-
ing or counter e.m.f. of self-induction.
7.9. Self-inductance
Fig. 7.11
Imagine a coil of wire similar to the one shown in Fig. 7.11 connected to a battery through a
rheostat. It is found that whenever an effort is made to increase current (and hence flux) through it, it
is always opposed by the instantaneous production of counter e.m.f. of self-induction. Energy required
to overcome this opposition is supplied by the battery. As will be fully explained later on, this energy
is stored in the additional flux produced.
If, now an effort is made to decrease the current (and hence the flux), then again it is delayed due
to the production of self-induced e.m.f., this time in the opposite direction. This property of the coil
due to which it opposes any increase or decrease or current of flux through it, is known as self-
inductance. It is quantitatively measured in terms of coefficient of self induction L. This property is
analogous to inertia in a material body. We know by experience that initially it is difficult to set a
heavy body into motion, but once in motion, it is equally difficult to stop it. Similarly, in a coil having
large self-induction, it is initially difficult to establish a current through it, but once established, it is
equally difficult to withdraw it. Hence, self-induction is sometimes analogously called electrical
inertia or electromagnetic inertia.
7.10. Coefficient of Self-induction (L)
It may be defined in any one of the three ways given below :
(i) First Method for L
The coefficient of self-induction of a coil is defined as
the weber-turns per ampere in the coil
By ‘weber-turns’ is meant the product of flux in webers and the number of turns with which the
flux is linked. In other words, it is the flux-linkages of the coil.
Consider a solenoid having N turns and carrying a current of I amperes. If the flux produced is
Φ webers, the weber-turns are NΦ. Hence, weber-turns per ampere are N Φ/I.
N Φ
By definition, L = . The unit of self-induction is henry*.
L
* After the American scientist Joseph Henry (1797 - 1878), a company of Faraday.Electromagnetic Induction 305
If in the above relation, NΦ = 1 Wb-turn, I = 1 ampere, then L = 1 henry (H)
Hence a coil is said to have a self-inductance of one henry if a current of 1 ampere when
flowing through it produced flux-linkages of 1 Wb-turn in it.
N Φ
Therefore, the above relation becomes L = henry
I
Example 7.8. The field winding of a d.c. electromagnet is wound with 960 turns and has resis-
tance of 50 Ω when the exciting voltages is 230 V, the magnetic flux linking the coil is 0.005 Wb.
Calculate the self-inductance of the coil and the energy stored in the magnetic field.
N Φ
Solution. Formula used : L = H
L
Current through coil = 230/50 = 4.6 A Φ = 0.005 Wb ; N = 960
L =

= 1.0435 H. Energy stored =

Second Method for L
We have seen in Art. 6.20 that flux produced in a solenoid is
Φ = NI ∴ Φ = N Now L = N Φ = N. N H
l/μ μ A I I/μ μ A I I/μ μ A
0 r 0 r 0 r
∴ L = l/μ N 0 μ 2 r A = N S 2 H or L= μ 0 μ r l AN2 H
It gives the value of self-induction in terms of the dimensions of the solenoid*.
Example 7.9. An iron ring 30 cm mean diameter is made of square of iron of 2 cm × 2 cm cross-
section and is uniformly wound with 400 turns of wire of 2 mm2 cross-section. Calculate the value of
the self-inductance of the coil. Assume μ = 800. (Elect. Technology. I, Gwalior Univ.)

Solution. L = μ μ AN2/l. Here N = 400 ; A = 2 × 2 = 4 cm2 = 4 × 10 −4 m2 ; l = 0.3 π m ; μ = 800
0 r r
∴ L = 4π × 10 −7 × 800 × 4 × 10 −4 (400)2/ = 68.3 mH
0.3 π
Note. The cross-section of the wire is not relevant to the given question.
Third Method for L
N Φ
It will be seen from Art. 7.10 (i) above that L = ∴ N Φ = LI or − NΦ = − L I

Differentiating both sides, we get − d (NΦ) = −L. dI (assuming L to be constant) ;

If = 1 ampere/second and e = 1 volt, then L = 1 H
dt L
Hence, a coil has a self-inductance of one henry if one volt is induced in it when current
through it changes at the rate of one ampere/second.
Example 7.10. If a coil of 150 turns is linked with a flux of 0.01 Wb when carrying current of
10 A, calculate the inductance of the coil. If this current is uniformly reversed in 0.01 second,
calculating the induced electromotive force.
Solution. L = NΦ/I = 150 × 0.01/10 = 0.15 H
Now, e = L dI/dt ; dI = − 10 − (− 10) = 20 A
L
∴ e = 0.15 × 20/0.01 = 300 V
L
* In practice, the inductance of a short solenoid is given by L = Kμ μ.AN2/l where K is Nagaoka’s constant.

Example 7.11. An iron rod, 2 cm in diameter and 20 cm long is bent into a closed ring and is
wound with 3000 turns of wire. It is found that when a current of 0.5 A is passed through this coil, the
flux density in the coil is 0.5 Wb/m2. Assuming that all the flux is linked with every turn of the coil,
what is (a) the B/H ratio for the iron (b) the inductance of the coil ? What voltage would be devel-
oped across the coil if the current through the coil is interrupted and the flux in the iron falls to 10 %

4 A, the flux density is 1.0 Wb/m2 and with 9A, it is 1.4 Wbm2. Find the mean value of the inductance

Example 7.13. A direct current of one ampere is passed through a coil of 5000 turns and
produces a flux of 0.1mWb. Assuming that whole of this flux threads all the turns, what is the
inductance of the coil ? What would be the voltage developed across the coil if the current were
interrupted in 10

(b) Though there would be additional energy loss of 52 × 2 = 50 W over the coil resistance,
energy stored in the coil would remain the same. However, voltage across the coil would increase by
an amount = 5 × 2 = 10 V i.e., now its value would be 210 V.
7.11. Mutual Inductance
In Art. 7.8 (Fig. 7.9) we have that any change of current in coil A is always accompanied by the
production of mutually-induced e.m.f. in coil B. Mutual inductance may, therefore, be defined as the
ability of one coil (or circuit) to produce an e.m.f. in a nearby coil by induction when the current in the
first coil changes. This action being reciprocal, the second coil can also induce an e.m.f. in the first
when current in the second coil changes. This ability of reciprocal induction is measured in terms of
the coefficient of mutual induction M.

7.12. Coefficient of Mutual Inductance (M)
It can also be defined in three ways as given below :
(i) First Method for M
Let there be two magnetically-coupled coils having N and N turns respectively (Fig. 7.9).
1 2
Coefficient of mutual inductance between the two coils is defined as
the weber-turns in one coil due to one ampere current in the other.308 Electrical Technology
Let a current I ampere when flowing in the first coil produce a flux Φ webers in it. It is
1 1
supposed that whole of this flux links with the turns of the second coil*. Then, flux-linkages i.e.,
webers-turns in the second coil for unit current in the first coil are N Φ/I . Hence, by definition

If weber-turns in second coil due to one ampere current in the first coil i.e. N Φ/I = 1 then, as
2 1 1
seen from above, M = 1H.
Hence, two coils are said to have a mutual inductance of 1 henry is one ampere current when
flowing in one coil produces flux-linkages of one Wb-turn in the other.
Example 7.16. Two identical coils X and Y of 1,000 turns each lie in parallel planes such that
80% of flux produced by one coil links with the other. If a current of 5 A flowing in X produces a flux
of 0.5 mWb in it, find the mutual inductance between X and Y. (Elect. Engg. A,M.Ae.S.I.)

Example 7.17. A long single layer solenoid has an effective diameter of 10 cm and is wound
with 2500 AT/metre. There is a small concentrated coil having its plane lying in the centre cross-
sectional plane of the solenoid. Calculate the mutual inductance between the two coils in each case
if the concentrated coil has 120 turns on an effective diameter of (a) 8 cm and (b) 12 cm.
(Elect. Science - II Allahabad Univ. 1992)

The constant k is called the coefficient of coupling and may be defined as the ratio of mutual
inductance actually present between the two coils to the maximum possible value. If the flux due
to one coil completely links with the other, then value of k is unity. If the flux of one coil does not at
all link with the other, then k = 0. In the first case, when k = 1, coils are said to be tightly coupled and
when k = 0, the coils are magnetically isolated from each other.
Example 7.23. Two identical 750 turn coils A and B lie in parallel planes. A current changing
at the rate of 1500 A/s in A induces an e.m.f. of 11.25 V in B. Calculate the mutual inductance of the

Example 7.29. Two similar coils have a coupling coefficient of 0.25. When they are connected
in series cumulatively, the total inductance is 80 mH. Calculate the self inductance of each coil.
Also calculate the total inductance when the coils are connected in series differentially.
(F. E. Pune Univ.)
Solution. If each coil has an inductance of L henry, then L = L = L ; M = k LL =k L×L = kL
1 2 1 2
When connected in series comulatively, the total inductance of the coils is
= L + L + 2M = 2L + 2M = 2L + 2kL = 2L (1 + 0.25) = 2.5L
1 2
∴ 2.5 L = 80 or L = 32 mH
When connected in series differentially, the total inductance of the coils is
= L + L − 2M = 2L − 2M = 2L − 2kL = 2L (1 − k) = 2L (1 − 0.25)

(cid:169) Magnetic hysteresis is one of the
important considerations in choosing and
designing the cores of transformers and
other electric machines318 Electrical Technology
8.1. Magnetic Hysteresis
It may be defined as the lagging of magnetisation or induction flux density (B) behind the
magnetising force (H). Alternatively, it may be defined as that quality of a magnetic substance, due to
which energy is dissipated in it, on the reversal of its magnetism.
Let us take an unmagnetised bar of iron AB and magnetise it by placing it within the field of a
solenoid (Fig. 8.1). The field H (= NI/l) produced by the solenoid is called the magnetising force.
The value of H can be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing current through the coil.
Let H be increased in steps from zero up to a certain maximum value and the corresponding values of
flux density (B) be noted. If we plot the relation between H and B, a curve like OA, as shown in Fig.
8.2, is obtained. The material becomes magnetically saturated for H = OM and has at that time a
maximum flux density of B established through it.
max
Fig. 8.1 Fig. 8.2
If H is now decreased gradually (by decreasing solenoid current), flux density B will not decrease
along AO, as might be expected, but will decrease less rapidly along AC. When H is zero, B is not but
has a definite value B = OC. It means that on removing the magnetising force H, the iron bar is not
r
completely demagnetised. This value of B (= OC) measures the retentivity or remanence of the
material and is called the remanent or residual flux density B.
r
To demagnetise the iron bar, we have to apply the magnetising force in the reverse direction.
When H is reversed (by reversing current through the solenoid), then B is reduced to zero at point D
where H = OD. This value of H required to wipe off residual magnetism is known as coercive force
(H ) and is a measure of the coercivity of the material i.e. its ‘tenacity’ with which it holds on to its
c
magnetism.
If, after the magnetisation has been reduced to zero, value of H is further increased in the ‘nega-
tive’ i.e. reversed direction, the iron bar again reaches a state of magnetic saturation, represented by
point L. By taking H back from its value corresponding to negative saturation, (= OL) to its value for
positive saturation (= OM), a similar curve EFGA is obtained. If we again start from G, the same
curve GACDEFG is obtained once again.*
* In fact, when H is varied a number of times between fixed positive and negative maxima, the size of the loop
becomes smaller and smaller till the material is cyclically magnetised. A material is said to be cyclically
magnetised when for each increasing (or decreasing) value of H, B has the same value in successive cycles.Magnetic Hysteresis 319
It is seen that B always lag behind H. The two never attain zero value simultaneously. This
lagging of B behind H is given the name ‘hystereis’ which literally means ‘to lag behind’. The closed
loop ACDEFGA which is obtained when iron bar is taken through one complete cycle of magnetisation
is known as ‘hypothesis loop’.
By one cycle of magnetisation of a magnetic material is meant its being carried through one
reversal of magnetisation, as shown in Fig. 8.3.
Fig. 8.3
8.2. Area of Hysteresis Loop
Just as the area of an indicator diagram measures the energy made available in a machine, when
taken through one cycle of operation, so also the area of the hysteresis loop represents the net energy
spent in taking the iron bar through one cycle of magnetisation.
According to Weber’s Molecular Theory of magnetism, when a magnetic material is magnetised,
its molecules are forced along a straight line. So, energy is spent in this process. Now, if iron has no
retentivity, then energy spent in straightening the molecules could be recovered by reducing H to
zero in the same way as the energy stored up in a spring can be recovered by allowing the spring to
release its energy by driving some kind of load. Hence, in the case of magnetisation of a material of
high retentivity, all the energy put into it originally for straightening the molecules is not recovered
when H is reduced to zero. We will now proceed to find this loss of energy per cycle of magnetisation.
Let l = mean length of the iron bar ; A = its area of cross-section; N = No. of turns of wire of the
solenoid.
If B is the flux density at any instant, then Φ = BA.
When current through the solenoid changes, then flux also changes and so produces an induced
e.m.f. whose value is
e = N dΦ volt= N d (BA)= NA dB volt (neglecting −ve sign)

Now H = or I =

‘e’ is = e I watt = Hl ×NA dB = AlH dB watt
N dt dt
Energy spent in time ‘dt’ = Al.H
dB×dt
= Al.H.dB joule
dt
Total net work done for one cycle of magnetisation is W = Al H dBjoule
where “ stands for integration over the whole cycle. Now, ‘H dB’ represents the shaded area in
Fig. 8.2. Hence, “HdB = area of the loop i.e. the area between the B/H curve and the B-axis
∴ work done/cycle = A × (area of the loop) joule. Now Al = volume of the material
l
∴ net work done/cycle/m3 = (loop area) joule, or W = (Area of B/H loop) joule m3/cycle
h
Precaution
Scale of B and H should be taken into consideration while calculating the actual loop area.
For example, if the scales are, 1 cm = x AT/m –for H and 1 cm = y Wb/m2 –for B
then W = xy (area of B/H loop) joule/m3/cycle
h320 Electrical Technology
In the above expression, loop area has to be in cm2.
As seen from above, hysteresis loop measures the energy dissipated due to hysteresis which
appears in the form of heat and so raises the
temperature of that portion of the magnetic cir-
cuit which is subjected to magnetic reversal.
The shape of the hysteresis loop depends on
the nature of the magnetic material (Fig. 8.4).
Loop 1 is for hard steel. Due to its high
retentivity and collectivity, it is well suited for
making permanent magnets. But due to large
hysteresis loss (as shown by large loop area) it
is not suitable for rapid reversals of magne-
tisation. Certain alloys of aluminium, nickel
and steel called Alnico alloys have been found
extremely suitable for making permanent mag-
nets.
Loop 2 is for wrought iron and cast steel. Fig. 8.4
It shows that these materials have high perme-
ability and fairly good coercivity, hence making them suitable for cores of electromagnets.
Loop 3 is for alloyed sheet steel and it shows high permeability and low hysteresis loss. Hence,
such materials are most suited for making armature and transformer cores which are subjected to
rapid reversals of magnetisation.
8.3. Properties and Applications of Ferromagnetic Materials
Ferromagnetic materials having low retentivities are widely used in power and communication
apparatus. Since silicon iron has high permeability and saturation flux density, it is extensively used
Step-up transformer
400 000 volts
core⎯→
22,000 volts
in the magnetic circuits of electrical machines and heavy current apparatus where a high flux density
is desirable in order to limit the cross-sectional area and, therefore, the weight and cost. Thin silicon-
iron laminations (clamped together but insulated from each other by varnish, paper or their own
surface scale) are used in the construction of transformer and armature cores where it is essential to
minimize hysteresis and eddy-current losses.
In field systems (where flux remains constant), a little residual magnetism is desirable. For such
systems, high permeability and high saturation flux density are the only important requirements which
are adequately met by fabricated rolled steel or cast or forged steel.
Frequencies used in line communication extend up to 10 MHz whereas those used in radio vary
from about 100 kHz to 10 GHz. Hence, such material which have high permeability and low losses
are very desirable. For these applications, nickel-iron alloys containing up to 80 per cent of nickel
and a small percentage of molybdenum or copper, cold rolled and annealed are very suitable.

netic chucks and moving-coil loudspeakers etc. In permanent magnets, high retentivity as well as
high coercivity are most desirable in order to resist demagnetisation. In fact, the product BH is the
r c
best criterion for the merit of a permanent magnet. The material commonly used for such purposes
are carbon-free iron-nickel-aluminium copper-cobalt alloys which are made anisotropic by heating to
a very high temperature and then cooling in a strong magnetic field. This alloy possesses B H value
r c
of about 40,000 J/m3 as compared with 2,500 J/m3 for chromium-steel.
Example 8.1. The hysteresis loop of a sample of sheet steel subjected to a maximum flux density
of 1.3 Wb/m2 has an area of 93 cm2, the scales being 1 cm = 0.1 Wb/m2 and 1 cm = 50 AT/m. Calcu-
late the hysteresis loss in watts when 1500 cm3 of the same material is subjected to an alternating
flux density of 1.3 Wb/m2 peak value of a frequency of 65 Hz.
(Electromechanics, Allahabad Univ, 1992)
Solution. Loss = xy (area of B/H loop) J/m3/cycle
= 0.1 × 50 × 93 = 465 J/m3/cycle
Volume = 1500 cm3 = 15 × 10 −4 m3 ; No. of reversals/second = 65
∴ W = 465 × 15 × 10 −4 × 65 J/s = 45.3 W

Example 8.2. Calculate the hourly loss of energy in kWh in a specimen of iron, the hysteresis
loop of which is equivalent in area to 250 J/m3. Frequency 50 Hz ; specific gravity of iron 7.5 ;
weight of specimen 10 kg. (Electrical Engg. Materials, Nagpur Univ. 1991)
Solution. Hysteresis loss = 250 J/m3/cycle, Mass of iron = 10 kg
Volume of iron specimen = 10/7.5 × 103 m3 = 10 −2/7.5 m3
No. of cycles of reversals/hr = 60 × 50 = 3000
∴ loss/hour = 250 × (10 −2/7.5) × 3000 = 1000 J = 1000/36 × 105 = 27.8 ××××× 10 −−−−−5 kWh
Example 8.3. The hysteresis loop for a certain magnetic material is drawn to the following
scales : 1 cm = 200 AT/m and 1 cm = 0.1 Wb/m2. The area of the loop is 48 cm2. Assuming the
density of the material to be 7.8 × 103 kg/m3, calculate the hysteresis loss in watt/kg at 50 Hz.
(Elect. Circuits & Fields, Gujarat Univ.)
Solution. Hysteresis loss = xy (area of B/H loop) J/m3/cycle
Now, 1 cm = 200 AT/m ; 1 cm = 0.1 Wb/m2
∴ x = 200, y = 0.1, area of loop = 48 cm2
∴ loss = 200 × 0.1 × 48 = 960 J/m3/cycles, Density = 7.8 × 102 kg/m2
Volume of 1 kg of material = mass/density = 1/7.8 × 103 m3
∴ loss = 960 × 1/7.8 × 103 J/cycle No. of reversals/second = 50
∴ loss = 960 × 50 × 10 −3/7.8 = 6.15 J/s or watt
∴ hysteresis loss = 6.15 watt/kg.
Example 8.4. Determine the hysteresis loss in an iron core weighing 50 kg having a density of
7.8 × 103 kg/m3 when the area of the hysteresis loop is 150 cm2, frequency is 50 Hz and scales on X
and Y axes are : 1 cm = 30 AT/cm and 1 cm = 0.2 Wb/m2 respectively.
(Elements of Elect. Engg-1, Bangalore Univ.)
Solution. Hysteresis loss = xy (area of B/H loop) J/m3/cycle
1 cm = 30 AT/cm = 3000 AT/m ; 1 cm = 0.2 Wb/m2
x = 3000, y = 0.2, A = 150 cm2
∴ loss = 3000 × 0.2 × 150 = 90,000 J/m3/cycle
Volume of 50 kg of iron = m/ρ = 50/7.8 × 10 −3 = 6.4 × 10 −3 m3
∴ loss = 90,000 × 6.4 × 10 −3 × 50 = 28,800 J/s or watts = 28.8 kW
Example 8.5. In a transformer core of volume 0.16 m3, the total iron loss was found to be 2,170
W at 50 Hz. The hysteresis loop of the core material, taken to the same maximum flux density, had an
area of 9.0 cm2 when drawn to scales of 1 cm = 0.1 Wb/m2 and 1 cm = 250 AT/m. Calculate the total
iron loss in the transformer core if it is energised to the same maximum flux density but at a frequency
of 60 Hz.322 Electrical Technology
Solution. W = xy × (area of hysteresis loop) where x and y are the scale factors.

At 50 Hz
Hysteresis loss = 225 × 0.16 × 50 = 1,800 W ; Eddy-current loss = 2,170 − 1800 = 370 W
At 60 Hz
Hysteresis loss = 1800 × 60/50 = 2,160 W ; Eddy-current loss = 370 × (60/50)2 = 533 W
Total iron loss = 2,160 + 533 = 2,693 W

8.5. Steinmetz Hysteresis Law
It was experimentally found by Steinmetz that hysteresis loss per m3 per cycle of magnetisation
of a magnetic meterial depends on (i) the maximum flux density established in it i.e. B and (ii) the
max
magnetic quality of the material.
∴ Hysteresis loss W α B1.6 joule/m3/cycle=ηB1.6 joule/m3cycle
h max max
where η is a constant depending on the nature of the magnetic material and is known as Steinmetz
hysteresis coefficient. The index 1.6 is empirical and holds good if the value of B lies between 0.1
max
and 1.2 Wb/m2. If B is either lesser than 0.1 Wb/m2 or greater than 1.2 Wbm2, the index is greater
max
than 1.6.
∴ W = ηB1.6 fV J/s or watt
h max
where f is frequency of reversals of magnetisation and V is the volume of the magnetic material.
The armatures of electric motors and generators and transformer cores etc. which are subjected
to rapid reversals of magnetisation should, obviously, be made of substances having low hysteresis
coefficient in order to reduce the hysteresis loss.
Example 8.6. A cylinder of iron of volume 8 × 10 − 3 m3 revolves for 20 minutes at a speed of
3,000 r.p.m in a two-pole field of flux density 0.8 Wb.m2. If the hysteresis coefficient of iron is 753.6
joule/m3, specific heat of iron is 0.11, the loss due to eddy current is equal to that due to hysteresis
and 25% of the heat produced is lost by radiation, find the temperature rise of iron. Take density of
iron as 7.8 × 103 kg/m3. (Elect. Engineering-I, Osmania Univ.)Magnetic Hysteresis 323
Solution. An armature revolving in a multipolar field undergoes one magnetic reversal after
passing under a pair of poles. In other words, number of magnetic reversals in the same as the number
of pair of poles. If P is the number of poles, the magnetic reversals in one revolution are
P/2. If speed of armature rotation is N r.p.m, then number of revolutions/second = N/60.

Heat produced = 506.4 × 103/4200 = 120.57 kcal ; Heat utilized = 120.57 × 0.75 = 90.43 kcal
Heat absorbed by iron = (8 × 10 − 3 × 7.8 × 103) × 0.11 t kcal
∴ (8 × 10 − 3 × 7.8 × 103) × 0.11 × t = 90.43 ∴ t = 13.17°C

8.6. Energy Stored in a Magnetic Field
For establishing a magnetic field, energy must be spent, though no energy is required to maintain
it. Take the example of the exciting coils of an electromagnet. The energy supplied to it is spent in
two ways (i) part of it goes to meet I2R loss and is lost once for all (ii) part of it goes to create flux and
is stored in the magnetic field as potential energy and is similar to the potential energy of a raised
weight. When a weight W is raised through a height of h, the potential energy stored in it is W . Work
h
is done in raising this weight but once raised to a certain height, no further expenditure of energy is
required to maintain it at that position. This mechanical potential energy can be recovered, so can be
the electrical energy stored in the magnetic field.
When current through an inductive coil is gradually changed from zero to maximum value I, then
every change of it is opposed by the self-induced e.m.f. produced due to this change. Energy is
needed to overcome this opposition. This energy is stored in the magnetic field of the coil and is, later
on, recovered when that field collapses. The value of this stored energy may be found in the follow-
ing two ways :
(i) First Method. Let, at any instant,
i = instantaneous value of current ; e = induced e.m.f. at that instant = L.di/dt
Then, work done in time dt in overcoming this opposition is
dW =
eidt=L. di ×i×dt=Lidi
dt
Total work done in establishing the maximum steady current of I is
∫W dW = ∫1 L.i.di=LI2 or W = 1 LI2
0 0 2
This work is stored as the energy of the magnetic field ∴ E = 1 LI2 joules
2
(ii) Second Method
If current grows uniformly from zero value to its maximum steady value I, then average current
is I/2. If L is the inductance of the circuit, then self-idcued e.m.f. is e = LI/t where ‘t’ is the time for
the current change from zero to I.
∴ Average power absorbed = induced e.m.f. × average current

∴ 117.7 = B2 × 3 × 10 − 4/4π × 10 − 7 ; B = 0.7 Wb/m2
If B/H curve is drawn, it will be found that for B = 0.7 Wb/m2, value of H = 45 AT/m.
Now, length of iron path = 40 cm = 0.4 m. AT required for iron path = 45 × 0.4 = 18
Value of H in the non-magnetic brass plates = B/μ = 0.7/4π × 10 − 7 = 557,042 AT/m
0
Total thickness of brass plates = 0.5 × 2 = 1 mm
AT required = 557,042 × 1 × 10 − 3 = 557, Total AT needed = 18 + 557 = 575
∴ magnetising current required = 557/800 = 0.72 A
Example 8.15. The arm of a d.c. shunt motor starter is held in the ‘ON’ position by an electro-
magnet having a pole face area of 4 cm2 and air gap of 0.6 mm. The torque exerted by the spring is
12 N-m and effective radius at which the force is exerted is 15 cm. What is the minimum number of
AT required to keep the arm in the ‘ON’ position ?328 Electrical Technology
Solution. The arm is shown in Fig. 8.8
Let F be the force in newtons exerted by the two poles of the
electromagnet.
Torque = Force × radius
∴ 12 = F × 0.15; F = 80 N
Force per pole = 80/2 = 40 N
Now F =

8.10. Rise of current in an Inductive Circuit
In Fig. 8.10 is shown a resistance of R in series with a coil of self-inductance L henry, the two
being put across a battery of V volt. The R-L combination becomes connected to battery when switch330 Electrical Technology
S is connected to terminal ‘a’ and is short-circuited when S
is connected to ‘b’. The inductive coil is assumed to be
resistanceless, its actual small resistance being included in
R.
When S is connected to ‘a’ the R-L combination is
suddenly put across the voltage of V volt. Let us take the
instant of closing S as the starting zero time. It is easily
explained by recalling that the coil possesses electrical inertia
i.e. self-inductance and hence, due to the production of the
counter e.m.f. of self-inductance, delays the instantaneous
Fig. 8.10
full establishment of current through it.
We will now investigate the growth of current i through
such an inductive circuit.
The applied voltage V must, at any instant, supply not only the ohmic drop iR over the resistance
R but must also overcome the e.m.f. of self inductance i.e. Ldi/dt.
∴ V = ν +ν =iR+ di
R L dt
or (V − iR) = L di ∴ di = dt . ...(i)
dt V −iR L
Multiplying both sides by (− R), we get (−R) di =− R dt
(V −iR) L
Integrating both sides, we get ∫(−R)di = ∫ dt ∴ logV−iR =− R t +K ...(ii)
(V −iR) e L
where e is the Napierian logarithmic base = 2.718 and K is constant of integration whose value can be
found from the initial known conditions.
To begin with, when t = 0, i = 0, hence putting these values in (ii) above, we get
logV = K
e
Substituting this value of K in the above given equation, we have
logV−iR = R t+logV or logV−iR −logV =− R t
e L e e e L
or log V −iR = −R t =− 1 where L/R = λ ‘time constant’
e V L λ
∴ V −iR = e −t/λ ori=V (1−e −t/λ )
V R
Now, V/R represents the maximum steady
value of current I that would eventually be es-
m
tablished through the R-L circuit.
∴ i = I (1 − e − t/λ ) ...(iii)
m
This is an exponential equation whose
graph is shown in Fig. 8.11. It is seen from it
that current rise is rapid at first and then
decreases until at t = ∞, it becomes zero.
Theoretically, current does not reach its
maximum steady value I until infinite time.
m
However, in practice, it reaches this value in a
relatively short time of about 5λ.
The rate of rise of current di/dt at any stage
can be found by differentiating Eq. (ii) above
Fig. 8.11
w.r.t. time. However, the initial rate of rise ofMagnetic Hysteresis 331
current can be obtained by putting t = 0 and i = 0 in (i)* above.
∴ V =0×R+ L di or di =V
dt dt L
The constant λ = L/R is known as the time-constant of the circuit. It can be variously defined as:
(i) It is the time during which current would have reached its maximum value of I (= V/R) had
m
it maintained its initial rate of rise.
Time taken = I m =V/R = L
initialrateof rise V/L R
But actually the current takes more time because its rate of rise decreases gradually. In actual
practice, in a time equal to the time constant, it merely reaches 0.632 of its maximum values as shown
below :
Putting t = L/R = λ in Eq. (iii) above, we get
i =I (1−e −λ/λ )=I ⎜ ⎛ 1− 1 ⎟ ⎞ =I ⎜ ⎛ 1− 1 ⎟ ⎞ =0.632I
m m⎝ e⎠ m⎝ 2.718⎠ m
(ii) Hence, the time-constant λ of an R-L circuit may also be defined as the time during which
the current actually rises to 0.632 of its maximum steady value (Fig. 8.11).
This delayed rise of current in an inductive circuit is utilized in providing time lag in the opera-
tion of electric relays and trip coils etc.
8.11. Decay of Current in an Inductive Circuit
When the switch S (Fig. 8.10) is connected to point ‘b’, the R-L circuit is short-circuited. It is
found that the current does not cease immediately, as it would do in a non-inductive circuit, but
continues to flow and is reduced to zero only after
an appreciable time has elapsed since the instant of
short-circuit.
The equation for decay of current with time is
found by putting V = 0 in Eq. (i) of Art. 8.10
0 = iR+L di or di =− R dt
dt i L
Integrating both sides, we have
∫di =− R ∫ dt ∴ logi= R t + K ...(i)
i L L
Now, at the instant of switching off current, i =
I and if time is counted from this instant, then
m
t = 0
∴ log I = 0 + K
e m
Putting the value of K in Eq (i) above, we get,
log i = − t = log I
e λ e m
∴ log i/I = − t Fig. 8.12
e m λ
* Initial value of di/dt can also be found by differentiating Eq. (iii) and putting t = 0 in it. In fact, the three
qunatities V, L, R give the following various combinations :
V/R = I – the maximum final steady current.
m
V/L = initial rate of rise of current.
L/R = time constant of the circuit.
The first rule of switching is that the current flowing through an inductance cannot change instantaneously.
The second rule of switching is that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously.332 Electrical Technology
∴ i = e − t/λ

or i = I e

It is decaying exponential function and is plotted in Fig. 8.12. It can be shown again that theo-
retically, current should take infinite time to reach zero value although, in actual practice, it does so in
a relatively short time of about 5λ.
Again, putting t = λ in Eq. (ii) above, we get
I I
i = m = m =0.37 I .
e 2.178 m
Hence, time constant (λ) of an R-L circuit may also be defined as the time during which current
falls to 0.37 or 37% of its maximum steady value while decaying (Fig. 8.12).
Example 8.17. A coil having an effective resistance of 20 Ω and an inductance of 5 H. is
suddenly connected across a 50-V dc supply. What is the rate at which energy is stored in the field of
the coil when current is (a) 0.5 A (b) 1.0 A and (c) steady ? Also find the induced EMF in the coil
under the above conditions.
Solution. (a) Power input = 50 × 0.5 = 25 W
Power wasted as heat = i2R = 0.52 × 25 = 6.25 W. Hence, rate of energy storage in the coil field
is 25 − 6.25 = 18.75 W or J/s. (b) Power input = 50 × 1 = 50 W
Power lost as heat = 12 × 25 = 25 W. ∴ Rate of energy storage in field = 50 − 25 = 25 W or J/s.
(c) Steady value of current = 50/25 = 2 A. Power input = 50 × 2 = 100 W
Power lost as heat = 22 × 25 = 100 W
Rate of energy storage in field = 100 − 100 = 0; Now, V = iR + e = V − iR
L
(a) e = 50 − 0.5 × 25 = 37.5 V (b) e = 50 − 1 × 25 = 25 V (c) e = 50 − 2 × 25 = 0 V.

Example 8.18. A coil having a resistance of 10 Ω and an inductance of 4 H is switched across
a 20-W dc source. Calculate (a) time required by the current to reach 50% of its final steady value
and (b) value of the current after 0.5 second.
Solution. The rise of current through an inductive circuit is given by the equation i = I (1 − e − t/λ ).
It may be written as
e − t/λ = I I − i or e I t/h = I I − i or ee/h = I I −i
Taking logs of both sides, we have
t .loge = logI/(I −i) = I I
λ n (I − i)
∴ Rt = R I or t = L l I
L n (I − i) R n I − i
(a) Now, I = V/R = 20/10 = 2 A
∴ t = 4 l 2 = 4 ×0.693= 0.2777 s.
10 n (2 −1) 10
(b) λ = L/R = 4/10 = 0.4 s and t = 0.5 s
∴ i = 2 (1 − e − t/0.4)
Example 8.19. With reference to the circuit shown in Fig. 8.13, calculate :
(i) the current taken from the d.c. supply at the instant of closing the switch
(ii) the rate of increase of current in the coil at the instant of switch
(iii) the supply and coil currents after the switch has been closed for a long time
(iv) the maximum energy stored in the coil
(v) the e.m.f. induced in the coil when the switch is opened.
Solution. (i) When switch S is closed (Fig. 8.13), the supply d.c. voltage of 120 V is appliedMagnetic Hysteresis 333
across both arms. The current in R will immediately become 120/
2
30 = 4 A. However, due to high inductance of the second arm, there
would be no instantaneous flow of current in it. Hence current taken
from the supply at the instant of switching on will be 4 A.
(ii) Since at the instant of switching on, there is no current
through the inductor arm, no potential drop will develop across R .
1
The whole of the supply voltage will be applied acorss the inductor.
If di/dt is the rate of increase of current through the inductor at the
Fig. 8.13
instant of switching on, the back e.m.f. produced in it is L. di/dt. This
e.m.f. is equal and opposite to the applied voltage.
120 = L di/dt or di/dt = 120/2 = 60 A/s
(iii) When switch has been closed for a sufficiently long time, current through the inductor arm
reaches a steady value = 120/R = 120/15 = 8 A
1
Current through R = 120/30 = 4 A ; Supply current = 8 + 4 = 12 A
2
(iv) Maximum energy stored in the inductor arm
= 1 LI 2 = 1 × 2×82 = 64 J
2 2
(v) When switch is opened, current through the inductor arm cannot change immediately because
of high self-inductance of the inductor. Hence, inductance current remains at 8 A. But the current
through R can change immediately. After the switch is opened, the inductor current path lies through
2
R and R . Hence, e.m.f. inducted in the inductor at the instant of switching off is = 8 × (30 + 15) =
1 2
360 V.
Example 8.20. A coil has a time constant of 1 second and an inductance of 8 H. If the coil is
connected to a 100 V d.c. source, determine :
(i) the rate of rise of current at the instant of switching (ii) the steady value of the current and
(iii) the time taken by the current to reach 60% of the steady value of the current.
(Electrotechnics-I, M.S. Univ. Baroda)
Solution. λ = L/R ; R = L/λ = 8/1 = 8 ohm
(i) Initial di/dt = V/L = 100/8 = 12.5 A/s (ii) I = V/R = 100/8 = 12.5 A
M
(iii) Here, i = 60% of 12.5 = 7.5 A
Now, i = I (1 − e −t/λ ) ∴ 7.5 = 12.5 (1 − e −t/1); t = 0.915 second

(iii) when i = 1 A; di = 80 −80×1 = 0.

In other words, the current has become steady at 1 ampere.
Example 8.22. The two circuits of Fig. 8.14 have the same time constant of 0.005 second. With the
same d.c. voltage applied to the two circuits, it is found that the steady state current of circuit (a) is 2000
times the initial current of circuit (b). Find R , L and C. (Elect. Engg.-I, Bombay Univ.)
1 1334 Electrical Technology
Solution. The time constant of circuit 8.14 (a) is λ = L /R second, and that of circuit 8.14 (b) is
1 1
λ = CR second.

∴ L /R = 0.005

C × 2 × 106 = 0.005, C = 0.0025 × 10 −6 = 0.0025 μF
Fig. 8.14
Steady-state current of circuit 8.14 (a) is = V/R = 10/R amperes.
1 1
Initial current of circuit 8.14 (b) = V/R = 10/2 × 106 = 5 × 10 −6 A*
2
Now 10/R = 2000 × 5 × 10 −6 ∴ R = 1000 Ω.

Also L /R = 0.005 ∴ L = 1000 × 0.005 = 5 H

Example 8.23. A constant voltage is applied to a series R-L circuit at t = 0 by closing a switch.
The voltage across L is 25 V at t = 0 and drops to 5 V at t = 0.025 second. If L = 2 H, what must be
the value of R ? (Elect. Engg.-I Bombay Univ.)
Solution. At t = 0, i = 0, hence there is no iR drop and the applied voltage must equal the back
e.m.f. in the coil. Hence, the voltage across L at t = 0 represents the applied voltage.
At t = 0.025 second, voltage across L is 5 V, hence voltage across
R = 25 − 5 = 20 V ∴ iR = 20 V − at t = 0.025 second. Now i = I (I − e −t/λ )
m
Here I = 25/R ampere, t = 0.025 second ∴ i = 25 (1− e −0.025/λ )
m R
R× 25 (1− e −0.025/λ ) = 20 or e0.025/λ = 5 ∴ 0.025/λ = 2.3 log 5 = 1.6077
R 10
∴ λ = 0.025/1.6077 Now λ = L/R = 2/R ∴ 2/R = 0.025/1.6077 ∴ R = 128.56 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Example 8.24. A circuit of resistance R ohms and inductance L henries has a direct voltage of
230 V applied to it. 0.3 second second after switching on, the current in the circuit was found to be
5 A. After the current had reached its final steady value, the circuit was suddenly short-circuited.
The current was again found to be 5 A at 0.3 second second after short-circuiting the coil. Find the
value of R and L. (Basic Electricity, Bombay Univ.)
Solution. For growth ; 5 = I (1 − e −0.3/λ ) ...(i)
m
For decay; 5 = I e
−0.3/λ
m
Equating the two, we get, I e −0.3/λ = (1 − e − 0.3/λ )I
m m
or 2 e −0.3/λ = 1 ∴ e −0.3/λ = 0.5 or λ = 0.4328
Putting this value in (i), we get,
5 = I = e0.3/0.4328 or I = 5 e+ 0.3/0.4328 = 5 × 2 = 10 A.
m m
Now, I = V/R ∴ 10 = 230/R or R = 230/10 = 23 Ω (approx.)
m
As λ = L/R = 0.4328 ; L = 0.4328 × 23 = 9.95 H
* Because just at the time of starting the current, there is no potential drop across C so that the applied
voltage is dropped across R . Hence, the initial charging current = V/R .

Example 8.25. A relay has a coil resistance of 20 Ω and an inductance of 0.5 H. It is energized
by a direct voltage pulse which rises from 0-10 V instantaneously, remains constant for 0.25 second
and then falls instantaneously to zero. If the relay contacts close when the current is 200 mA (in-
creasing) and open when it is 100 mA (decreasing), find the total time during which the contacts are
closed.
Solution. The time constant of the relay coil is
λ = L/R = 0.5/20 = 0.025 second
Now, the voltage pulse remains constant at 10 V for 0.25 second which is long enough for the
relay coil current to reach its steady value of V/R = 10/20 = 0.5 A
Let us now find the value of time required by the relay coil current to reach a value of 200
mA = 0.2 A. Now i = I (1 − e −t/λ ) ∴ 0.2 = 0.5 (1 − e −t/0.025) ∴ e40/t = 5/3
m
∴ t = 0.01276 second
Hence, relay contacts close at t = 0.01276 second and will remain closed till current falls to
100 mA. Let us find the time required by the current to fall from 0.5 A to 0.1 A.
At the end of the voltage pulse, the relay current decays according to the relation
i = I e − t/λ ∴ 0.1 = 0.5 e −t/0.025 ∴ e40 t = 5
m
∴ t = 0.04025 second after the end of the voltage pulse.
Hence, the time for which contacts remain closed is
= (0.25 − 0.01276) + 0.04025 second = 277.5 milli-second (approx)
8.12. Details of Transient Current Rise in an R-L Circuit
As shown in Fig.
8.15 (a), when switch S
is shifted to position a,
the R-L circuit is sud-
denly energised by V.
Since a coil opposes any
change in current, the ini-
tial value of current is
zero at t = 0 and but then
it rises exponentially, al-
though its rate of rise
keeps decreasing. After
some time, it reaches a
maximum value of I
m
when it becomes constant
i.e. its rate of rise be-
comes zero. Hence, just Fig. 8.15
at the start of the transient
state, i = 0, V = 0 and V = V with its polarity opposite to that of battery voltage as shown in Fig. 8.15

(a). Both i and V rise exponentially during the transient state, as shown in Fig. 8.15 (b) and (c)
R
respectively. However V decreases exponentially to zero from its initial maximum value of V = I R.
L m
It does not become negative during the transient rise of current through the circuit.
Hence, during the transient rise of current, the following equations hold good :
i = V (1− e −t/λ ) = I (1 − e −t/λ ) ; V = iR = V (1 − e −t/λ ) = I R (1 − e −t/λ ); v = Ve −t/λ
R m R m L
If S remains at ‘a’ long enough, i reaches a steady value of I and V equals I R but since
m R m
di/dt = 0, v = 0.

8.16 is applied to an inductor of 0.2 H, find the
current in the inductor at t = 2 sec.
Solution. L(di/dt) = 2 volts, for t between
0 and 1 sec, and corresponding value of di/dt =
2/0.2 = 10 amp/sec, uniform during this period.
After t > 1 voltage is zero, hence di/dt = 0

8.13. Details of Transient Current Decay in an R-L Circuit
Now, let us consider the conditions during the transient decay of current when S is shifted to
point ‘b’. Just at the start of the decay condition, the following values exist in the circuit.
i = I = V/R, v = I R= V and since initial di/dt is maximum, v = − V = − I R.

Fig. 8.17
The change in the polarity of voltage across the coil in Fig. 8.17 (a) is worth noting. Due to its
property of self-induction, the coil will not allow the circuit current to die immediately, but only
gradually. In fact, by reversing the sign of its voltage, the coil tends to maintain the flow of currrent
in the original direction. Hence, as the decay continues i decreases exponentially from its maximum
value to zero, as shown in Fig. 8.17 (b). Similarly, v decreases exponentially from its maximum
R
value to zero, as shown in Fig. 8.17 (c). However, v is reversed in polarity and decreases exponen-
L
tially from its initial value of − V to zero as shown in Fig. 8.17 (d).

8.14. Automobile Ignition System
Practical application of
mutual induction is found in the
single-spark petrol-engine
ignition system extensively
employed in automobiles and air-
engines. Fig. 8.18 shows the
circuit diagram of such a system
as applied to a 4-cylinder
automobile engine.
It has a spark coil (or
induction coil) which consists of
a primary winding (of a few
turns) and a secondary winding Fig. 8.18
(of a large number of turns)
wound on a common iron core (for increasing mutual induction). The primary circuit (containing
battery B) includes a ‘make and break contact’ actuated by a timer cam. The secondary circuit
includes the rotating blade of the distributor and the spark gap in the spark plug as shown in Fig. 8.17.
The timer cam and the distributor are mounted on the same shaft and are geared to rotate at exactly
half the speed of the engine shaft. It means that in the case of automobile engines (which are four-
cycle engines) each cylinder is fired only once for every two revolutions of the engine shaft.
Working
When timer cam rotates, it alternately closes and opens the primary circuit. During the time
primary circuit is closed, current through it rises exponentially after the manner shown in Fig. 8.11
and so does the magnetic field of the primary winding. When the cam suddenly opens the primary
circuit, the magnetic field collapses rapidly thereby producing a very large e.m.f. in secondary by
mutual induction. During the time this large e.m.f. exists, the distributor blade rotates and connects
the secondary winding across the proper plug and so the secondary circuit is completed except for the
spart gap in the spark plug. However, the induced e.m.f. is large enough to make the current jump
across the gap thus producing a spark which ignites the explosive mixture in the engine cylinder.
The function of capacitor C connected across the ‘make and break’ contact is two-fold :
(i) to make the break rapid so that large e.m.f. is induced in secondary and
(ii) to reduce sparking and burning at the ‘make-and-break’ contact thereby prolonging their
life.

9.1. Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis
From his experiments, Faraday deduced two fundamental
laws which govern the phenomenon of electrolysis. These are :
(i) First Law. The mass of ions liberated at an electrode is
directly proportional to the quantity of electricity i.e. charge which
passes through the electrolyte.
(ii) Second Law. The masses of ions of different substances
liberated by the same quantity of electricity are proportional to
their chemical equivalent weights.
Explanation of the First Law
Michael Faraday
If m = mass of the ions liberated, Q = quantity of electricity = I × t where I is the current and t is
the time, then according to the first law m α Q or m = Z Q or m = Z It
where Z is a constant and is known as the electrochemical equivalent (E.C.E.) of the substance.
If Q = 1 coulomb i.e. I = 1 ampere and t = 1 second, then m = Z.
Hence, E.C.E. of a substance is equal to the mass of its ions liberated by the passage of one
ampere current for one second through its electrolytic solution or by the passage of a charge of
one coulomb.
In fact, the constant Z is composite and it depends on the valency and atomic weight of the
substance concerned. Its value is given by Z = ⎛ ⎜ 1 . a ⎞ ⎟ where a is the atomic weight, v the valency
⎝F v ⎠
and F is Faraday’s constant. It is so because m is proportional to atomic weight, since each ion carries
a definite charge. Obviously, the charge carried by an ion is proportional to its valency. Now, con-
−
sider the molecules of sulphuric acid and copper sulphate. The sulphion SO in the acid molecule is
4
combined with two positive hydrogen ions, whereas in CuSO molecule, it is combined only with one
positive (bivalent) Cu++ ion. It is seen that a copper ion bein 4 g bivalent carries twice the charge of a
hydrogen ion which is univalent (monovalent). It means that in order to transfer a given quantity of
electricity, only one-half as many bivalent copper ions as univalent hydrogen ions will be required. In
other words, greater is the valency of an ion, smaller is the number of ions needed to carry a given
quantity of electricity or charge which means that the mass of an ion liberated is inversely propor-
tional to its valency.
∴ m = ⎛ ⎜ 1 . a ⎞ ⎟ It = ⎛ ⎜ 1 . a ⎞ ⎟Q = E .Q
⎝F v ⎠ ⎝F v ⎠ F
where E is the chemical equivalent weight (= a/v).
The constant F is known as Faraday’s constant. The value of Faraday’s constant can be found
thus. It is found that one coulomb liberates 0.001118 gram of silver. Moreover, silver is univalent
and its atomic weight is 107.88. Hence, substituting these values above, we find that
0.001118 =
1 .107.88×1
F
∴ F = 107.88 / 0.001118 = 96,500 coulomb, which corresponds to 96,500/3600 = 26.8 Ah
Faraday’s constant is defined as the charge required to liberate one gram-equivalent of any
substance.
chemical equivalent (E)
For all substances, = Faraday’s constant (F) = 96,500 coulomb
electrochemical equivalent (Z)
or F = E/ZElectrochemical Power Sources 341
Explanation of the Second Law
Suppose an electric current is passed for the same time through acidulated water, solution of
CuSO and AgNO , then for every 1.0078 (or 1.008) gram of hydrogen evolved, 107.88 gram of
4 3
silver and 31.54 gram of Cu are liberated. The values 107.88 and 31.54 represent the equivalent
weights* of silver and copper respectively i.e. their atomic weights (as referred to hydrogen) divided
by their respective valencies.
Example 9.1. Calculate the time taken to deposit a coating of nickel 0.05 cm thick on a metal
surface by means of a current of 8 A per cm2 of surface. Nickel is a divalent metal of atomic weight
59 and of density 9 gram/cm3. Silver has an atomic weight of 108 and an E.C.E. of 1.118 mg/C.
Solution. Wt. of nickel to be deposited per cm2 of surface = 1× 0.05 × 9 = 0.45 g
E.C.E.of Ni chemicalequivalent of Ni
Now =

∴ E.C.E. of Ni = 1.118×10 −3 × (59/2) = 0.0003053g/C

(chemical equivalent = atomic wt./valency)
Now m = ZIt ∴ 0.45 =0.0003053 × 8 × t ; t = 184 second = 3 min. 4 second
Exmaple 9.2. If 18.258 gm of nickel are deposited by 100 amp flowing for 10 minutes, how
much copper would be deposited by 50 amp for 6 minutes : Atomic weight of nickel = 58.6 and that
of copper 63.18. Valency of both is 2. (Electric Power AMIE Summer 1991)
Solution. From Faraday’s first law, we get m = ZIt = m ⎛ ⎜ 1 . a ⎞ ⎟ It.

Example 9.3. The cylindrical surface of a shaft of diameter 12 cm and length 24 cm is to be
repaired by electrodeposition of 0.1 cm thick nickel on it. Calculate the time taken if the current used
is 100 A. The following data may be used :
Specific gravity of nickel = 8.9 ; Atomic weight of nickel = 58.7 (divalent) ; E.C.E. of silver =
1.2 mg/C; Atomic weight of silver = 107.9. (Elect. Engg. A.M.Ae. S.I. June, 1991)
Solution. Curved surface of the salt = πD × l = π × 12 × 24 cm2
Thickness of nickel layer = 0.1 cm
Volume of nickel to be deposited = 12π × 24 × 0.1 = 90.5 cm3
Mass of nickel deposited = 90.5 × 8.9 = 805.4 g
Chemical equivalent of Ni = atomic weight = 58.7 = 29.35

∴ E.C.E.of Ni = 1.12 × 29.35/107.9 = 0.305 mg/C
Now m = ZIt
∴ 805.4= 0.305 × 10 − 3 × 100 × t ∴ t = 26,406 second or 7 hr, 20 min 7 s
Example 9.4. The worn-out part of a circular shaft 15 cm in diameter and 30 cm long is to be
repaired by depositing on it 0.15 cm of Nickel by an electro-depositing process. Estimate the qunatity
of electricity required and the time if the current density is to be 25 mA/cm2. The current efficiency
of the process may be taken as 95 per cent. Take E.C.E. for nickel as 0.3043 mg/coulomb and the
density of nickel as 8.9 g/cm3. (Elect. Power-I, Bangalore Univ.)
Solution. Curved surface area of shaft = π D × l = π × 15 × 30 = 1414 cm2.
Thickness of nickel layer = 0.15 cm
Volume of nickel to be deposited = 1414 × 0.15 = 212 cm3
Mass of nickel to be deposited = 212 × 8.9 = 1887 gram
Now, m = ZQ; Q = m/Z = 1887/0.343 × 10 −3 = 62 × 105 C
Now, current density = 15 ×10 −3 A/cm2; A = 1414 cm2
I = 25 × 10
−3
× 1414 = 35.35 A
Since Q = It ∴ t = 62 × 105/35.35 = 1.7 × 105s = 47.2 hr.
Example 9.5. A refining plant employs 1000 cells for copper refining. A current of 5000 A is
used and the voltage per cell is 0.25 volt. If the plant works for 100 hours/week, determine the
annual output of refined copper and the energy consumption in kWh per tonne. The electrochemical
equivalent of copper is 1.1844 kg/1000 Ah.
(Electric Drives and Utilization, Punjab Univ. Jan. 1991)
Solution. Total cell voltage = 0.25 × 1000 = 250 V; I = 5000 A; plant working time = 100 hour/
week = 100 × 52 = 5200 hour/year; Z = 1.1844 kg/1000 Ah; 1 Ah = 1 × 60 × 60 = 3600 C;
∴ Z = 1.1844 kg/1000 × 3600 = 0.329 × 10 − 6 kg/C.
According to Faraday’s law of Electrolysis, the amount of refined copper produced per year is
m = Z I t = 0.329 × 10
−6
× 5000 × (5200 × 3600) = 3079 kg = 3.079 tonne.
Hence, annual output of refined copper = 3.079 tonne
Energy consumed per year = 250 × 5000 × 5200/1000 = 6500 kWh
This is the energy consumed for refining 3.079 tonne of copper
∴ Energy consumed per tonne = 6500/3.079 = 2110 kWh/tonne.
Example 9.6. A sheet of iron having a total surface area of 0.36 m2 is to be electroplated with
copper to a thickness of 0.0254 mm. What quantity of electricity will be required ? The iron will be
made the cathode and immersed, together with an anode of pure copper, in a solution of copper
sulphate.
(Assume the mass density of copper = 8.96 × 103 kg m − 3; E.C.E. of copper —32.9 × 10 − 8 kg C1
Current density = 300 Am − 2) (AMIE Sec. B Utilisation of Electric Power Summer 1992)
Solution. Area over which copper is to be deposited = 0.36 m2
Thickness of the deposited copper = 0.0254 × 10 − 3 m
Volume of deposited copper = 0.36 × 0.0254 × 10 − 3 = 9.144 × 10 − 6 m3
Mass of copper deposited = volume × density
= 9.144 × 10 − 6 × 8.96 × 103 = 0.0819 kg

9.2. Polarisation of Back E.M.F.
Let us consider the case of two platinum electrodes dipped in dilute sulphuric acid solution.
When a small potential difference is applied across the electrodes, no current is found to flow. When,
however, the applied voltage is increased, a time comes when a temporary flow of current takes place.
The H+ ions move towards the cathodes and O-- ions move towards the anode and are absorbed there.
These absorbed ions have a tendency to go back into the electolytic solution, thereby leaving them as
oppositely-charged electrodes. This tendency produces an e.m.f. that is in opposition to the applied
voltage which is consequently reduced.
This opposing e.m.f. which is produced in an electrolyte due to the absorption of gaseous ions
by the electrolyte from the two electrodes is known as the back e.m.f. of electolysis or polarisation.
The value of this back e.m.f. is different from different electrolytes. The minimum voltage
required to decompose an electrolyte is called the decomposition voltage for that electrolyte.
9.3. Value of Back E.M.F.
For producing electrolysis, it is necessary that the applied voltage must be greater than the back
e.m.f. of electrolysis for that electrolyte. The value of this back e.m.f. of electrolysis can be found
thus :
Let us, for example, find the decomposition voltage of water. We will assume that the energy
required to separate water into its constituents (i.e. oxygen and hydrogen) is equal to the energy
liberated when hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water. Let H kcal be the amount of heat energy
absorbed when 9 kg of water are decomposed into 1 kg of hydrogen and 8 kg of oxygen. If the
electrochemical equivalent of hydrogen is Z kg/coulomb, then the passage of q coulomb liberates Zq
kg of hydrogen. Now, H is the heat energy required to release 1 kg of hydrogen, hence for releasing
Zq kg of hydrogen, heat energy required is HZq kcal to JHZq joules. If E is the decomposition
voltage, then energy spent in circulating q coulomb of charge is Eq joule. Equating the two amounts
of energies, we have
Eq = JHZq or E = JHZ
where J is 4200 joule/kcal.
The e.m.f. of a cell can be calculated by determining the two electrode potentials. The electrode
potential is calculated on the assumption that the electrical energy comes entirely from the heat of the
reactions of the constituents. Let us take a zinc electrode. Suppose it is given that 1 kg of zinc when
dissolved liberates 540 kcal of heat and that the electrochemical equivalent of zinc is 0.338 × 10 − 6
kg/coulomb. As calculated above,
E = JHZ = 4200 × 540 × 0.338 × 10 − 6 = 0.76 volt
The electrode potentials are usually referred to in terms of the potential of a standard hydrogen
electrode i.e. an electrode of hydrogen gas at normal atmospheric pressure and in contact with a
normal acid solution. In table No. 9.1 are given the elctrode potentials of various elements as referred
to the standard hydrogen electrode. The elements are assumed to be in normal solution and at
atmospheric pressure.344 Electrical Technology
In the case of Daniel cell having copper and zinc electrodes, the copper electrode potential with
respect to hydrogen ion is + 0.345 V and that of the zinc electrode is − 0.758 V. Hence, the cell e.m.f.
is 0.345 − (− 0.758) = 1.103 volt. The e.m.f. of other primary cells can be found in a similar way.

Copper + 0.345 Nickel − 0.231
Hydrogen 0 Potassium − 2.922

Example 9.7. Calculate the weight of zinc and MnO required to produce I ampere-hour in a
2
leclanche cell.
Atomic weights : Mn, 55 ; O, 16 ; Zn, 65. E.C.E. of hydrogen = 1.04 × 10 − 8 kg/C.
Solution. 1 ampere-hour = 3600 A-s = 3600 C
Wt. of hydrogen liberated = Zq = 1.04 × 10 −8 × 3600 = 37.44 × 10 − 6 kg
Now, the chemical reactions in the cell are

It is seen that 1 atom of zinc is used up in liberating two
atoms of hydrogen. In other words, to produce 2 kg of hydro-
gen, 65 kg of zinc will have to go into chemical combination.
∴ Zinc required to produce 37.44 × 10 −6 kg of hydro-

It is seen that 174 kg of MnO combine with 2 kg of hydrogen, hence Wt. of MnO needed to
combine with 37.44 × 10 − 6 kg of h 2 ydrogen = 37.44 × 10 − 6 × 174/2 = 3.258 × 10 − 3 kg. 2
Hence, for 1 ampere-hour, 1.217 × 10 −−−−− 3 kg of zinc and 3.258 × 10 −−−−− 3 kg of MnO are needed.

9.4. Primary and Secondary Batteries
An electric battery consists of a number of electrochemical cells, connected either in series or
parallel. A cell, which is the basic unit of a
battery, may be defined as a power generating
device, which is capable of converting stored
chemical energy into electrical energy. If the
stored energy is inherently present in the
chemical substances, it is called a primary
cell or a non-rechargeable cell. Accordingly,
the battery made of these cells is called
primary battery. The examples of primary
cells are Leclanche cell, zinc-chlorine cell,
alkaline-manganese cell and metal air cells
etc.
Secondary batteryElectrochemical Power Sources 345
If, on the other hand, energy is induced in the chemical substances by applying an external
source, it is called a secondary cell or rechargeable cell. A battery made out of these cells is called a
secondary battery or storage battery or rechargeable battery. Examples of secondary cells are lead-
acid cell, nickel-cadmium cell, nickel-iron cell, nickel-zinc cell, nickel-hydrogen cell, silver-zinc cell
and high temperature cells like lithium-chlorine cell, lithium-sulphur cell, sodium-sulphur cell etc.
9.5. Classification of Secondary Batteries Based on Their Use
Various types of secondary batteries can be grouped in to the following categories as per their
use:
1. Automotive Batteries or SLI Batteries or Portable Batteries
These are used for starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) in internal-combustion-engined vehicles.
Examples are; lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium batteries etc.
2. Vehicle Traction Batteries or Motive Power Batteries or Industrial Batteries
These are used as a motive power source for a wide variety of vehicles. Lead-acid batteries,
nickel-iron batteries, silver-zinc batteries have been used for this purpose. A number of advance
batteries including high-temperature batteries are under development for electric vehicle (EV) use.
These high-temperature batteries like sodium-sulphur and lithium-iron sulphide have energy densi-
ties in the range of 100-120 Wh/kg.
3. Stationary Batteries.
These fall into two groups (a) standby power system which is used intermittently and (b) load-
levelling system which stores energy when demand is low and, later on, uses it to meet peak demand.
9.6. Classification of Lead Storage Batteries
Lead storage batteries may be classified according to the service which they provide.
1. SLI Batteries
The primary purpose of
these batteries is to supply power
for engine starting, lighting and
ignition (SLI) of vehicles pro-
pelled by IC engines such as au-
tomobiles, buses, lorries and
other heavy road vehicles and
motor cycles etc. Usually, these
batteries provide 12 V and con-
sist of six series-connected lead-
acid cells with capacity of the
other of 100 Ah. Their present-
day energy density is about HSO
45 Wh/kg and 75 Wh/dm3. (e 2 lectr 4 olyte)
These days ‘maintenance- Lead grid packed with Lead grid packed
with PbO(cathode)
free’ (MF) SLI batteries have spongy lead (anode) 2
been designed, which do not re-
Lead storage batteries
quire the addition of water
throughout their normal service life of 2-5 years. MF versions of the SLI batteries are constructed of
such material that no gassing occurs during charging. In MF batteries, the electrolyte is either ab-
sorbed within the microporous separators and the plates or is immobilized with suitable gelling agents.
These days the SLI battereis are charged from an alternator (AC generator) and not from dynamo
(DC generator). The alternating current produced by the alternator is converted into direct current by346 Electrical Technology
a full-wave bridge rectifier, which uses semi-conductor diodes. In this arrangement, no cutout is
needed and the transistorised voltage controller regulates the alternator output to suit the electrical
load and the state of charge of the battery. The battery is charged under constant-voltage conditions.
2. Vehicle Traction Batteries
The recent universal concern over the levels of toxic gases (particularly in urban areas) emitted
by the IC engines has revived interest in electric traction. There has been great development in the
use of battery-powered vehicles, primarily industrial trucks and commercial road vehicles of various
types like ‘milk floats’ (i.e. bottled-milk delivery trucks), fork lift trucks, mining, airport tractors,
aircraft service vehicles, electric cars and, more recently, in robotics and guided vehicles.
Traction batteries are of higher quality than SLI batteries. They provide constant output voltage,
high volumetric capacity, good resistance to vibration and a long service life. They can withstand
prolonged and deep discharges followed by deep recharges usually on a daily basis. The voltage of
traction batteries varies from 12 V to 240 V and they have a cycle life of 1000-1500 cycles.
A number of advanced batteries and under development for EV use (i) room temperature batter-
ies like zinc-nickel oxide battery (75 Wh/kg) and zinc-chlorine hydrate battery (80 Wh/kg) and
(ii) high-temperature batteries like sodium-sulphur battery (120 Wh/kg) and lithium-iron sulphide
battery (100 Wh/kg).
3. Stationary Batteries
Their use falls into two groups :
(a) as standby power system and (b) as load-levelling system.
In the standby applications, the battery is used to power essential equipment or to provide alarms
or emergency lighting, in case of break-down in the main power supply. Standby applications have
increased in recent years with increasing demand for uninterruptable power systems (UPS) and a
tremendous growth in new telecommunication networks. The UPS provides ‘clean’ a.c supply free
of sage or surges in the line voltage, frequency variations, spikes and transients to modern computer
and electronic equipment. Banks of sealed lead-acid (SLA) standby batteries have been recently used
in telecommunication systems and for UPS applications.
Recently, advanced lead-acid batteries have been used for load-levelling purpose in the electric
generating plants. A 100 M Wh lead-acid battery load-levelling system could occupy a building two
and a half storey high and an area of about 250,000 m2.
9.7. Parts of a Lead-acid Battery
A battery consists of a number of cells and each cell of the battery-consists of (a) positive and
negative plants (b) separators and (c) electrolyte, all contained in one of the many compartments of
the battery container.* Different parts of a lead-acid battery are as under :
(i) Plates. A plate consists of a lattice type of grid of cast antimonial lead alloy which is covered
with active material (Art. 9.8). The grid not only serves as a support for the fragile active material but
also conducts electric current. Grid for the positive and negative plates are often of the same design
although negative plate grids are made somewhat lighter. As discussed in Art. 9.10, positive plates
are usually Plante plates whereas negative plates are generally of Faure or pasted type.
(ii) Separators. These are thin sheets of a porous material placed between the positive and
negative plates for preventing contact between them and thus avoiding internal short-circuiting of the
battery. A separator must, however, be sufficiently porous to allow diffusion or circulation of electro-
lyte between the plates. These are made of especially-treated cedar wood, glass wool mat, microporous
rubber (mipor), microporous plastics (plastipore, miplast) and perforated p.v.c. as shown in Fig. 9.1.
In addition to good porosity, a separator must possess high electrical resistance and mechanical strength.
* The most common form of lead-acid cell used for marine applications is the tubular cell which consists of
‘armoured’ tubular positive plate of standard flat negative plate.Electrochemical Power Sources 347
(iii) Electrolyte. It is dilute sulphuric acid which fills the cell compartment to immerse the plates
completely.
Fig. 9.1
(iv) Container. It may be made of vulcanised rubber or
moulded hard rubber (ebonite), moulded plastic, ceramics, glass
or celluloid. The vulcanised rubber containers are used for car
service, while glass containers are superior for lighting plants and
wireless sets. Celluloid containers are mostly used for portbable
wireless set batteries. A single monoblock type container with 6
compartments generally used for starting batteries is shown in Fig.
9.2. Full details of a Russian 12-CAM-28 lead-acid battery parts
are shown in Fig. 9.3. Details of some of these parts are as follows:

support the plates and hold them in position and at the same time protect them from short-circuits that
would otherwise occur as a result of fall of the active material from the plates onto the bottom of the
container.
(b) Connecting Bar. It is the lead alloy link which joins the cells together in series connecting
the positive pillar of one cell to the negative pillar of the next one.
(c) Terminal Post or Pillar. It is the upward extension from each connecting bar which passes
through the cell cover for cable connections to the outside circuits. For easy indentification, the
negative terminal post is smaller in diameter than the positive terminal post.
(d) Vent Plugs or Filler Caps. These are made of polystyrene or rubber and are usually screwed
in the cover. Their function is to prevent escape of electrolyte but allow the free exit of the gas. These
can be easily removed for topping up or taking hydrometer readings.
(e) External Connecting Straps. These are the antimonial lead alloy flat bars which connect the
positive terminal post of one cell to the negative of the next across the top of the cover. These are of
very solid construction especially in starting batteries because they have to carry very heavy currents.
9.8. Active materials of a Lead-acid Cell
Those substances of the cell which take active part in chemical combination and hence absorb or
porduce electricity during charging or discharging, are known as active materials of the cell.
The active materials of a lead-acid cell are :
1. Lead peroxide (PbO ) for + ve plate 2. Sponge Lead (Pb) for − ve plate 3. Dilute Sulphuric
2
Acid (H SO ) as electrolyte.
2 4
1. Lead Peroxide
It is a combination of lead and oxygen, is dark chocolate brown in colour and is quite hard but
brittle substance. It is made up of one atom of lead (Pb) and two atoms of oxygen (O ) and its
2
chemical formula is PbO . As said earlier, it forms the positive active material.
2
2. Sponge Lead
It is pure lead in soft sponge or porous condition. Its chemical formula is Pb and forms the
negative active material.
3. Dilute Sulphuric Acid
It is approximately 3 parts water and one part sulphuric acid. The chemical formula of the acid
is H SO . The positive and negative plates are immersed in this solution which is known as electro-
2 4
lyte. It is this medium through which the current produces chemical changes.
Hence, the lead-acid cell depends for its action on the presence of two plates covered with
PbO and Pb in a solution of dilute H SO of specific gravity 1.21 or nearabout.
2 2 4
Lead in the form of PbO or sponge Pb has very little mechanical strength, hence it is supported
2
by plates of pure lead. Those plates covered with or otherwise supporting PbO are known as + ve
2
plates and those supporting sponge lead are called −ve plates. The + ve and −ve plates are arranged
alternately and are connected to two common +ve and −ve terminals. These plates are assembled in
a suitable jar or container to make a complete cell as discussed in Art. 9.4 above.
9.9. Chemical changes
(i) DISCHARGING (Fig. 9.4)
When the cell is fully charge, its positive plate or anode is PbO (dark chocolate brown) and the
2
negative plate or cathode is Pb (slate grey). When the cell discharges i.e. it sends current through the
external load, then H SO is dissociated into positive H and negative SO ions. As the current within
2 4 2 4
the cell is flowing from cathode to anode, H ions move to anode and SO ions move to the cathode.
2 4
At anode (PbO ), H combines with the oxygen of PbO and H SO attacks lead to form PbSO .
2 2 2 2 4 4
PbO + H + H SO ⎯→ PbSO + 2H O
2 2 2 4 4 2Electrochemical Power Sources 349
At the cathode (Pb), SO combines with it to form PbSO
4 4
Pb + SO ⎯→ PbSO
4 4
Fig. 9.4 Fig. 9.5
It will be noted that during discharging :
(i) Both anode and cathode become PbSO which is somewhat whitish in colour.
4
(ii) Due to formation of water, specific gravity of the acid decreases.
(iii) Voltage of the cell decreases. (iv) The cell gives out energy.
(ii) CHARGING (Fig. 9.5)
When the cell is recharged, the H ions move to cathode and SO ions go to anode and the
2 4
following changes take place :
At Cathode PbSO + H ⎯⎯→ Pb + H SO
4 2 2 4
At Anode PbSO + 2H O ⎯⎯→ PbO + 2H SO
4 2 2 2 4
Hence, the anode and cathode again become PbO and Pb respectively.
2
(i) The anode becomes dark chocolate brown in colour (PbO ) and cathode becomes grey
2
metallic lead (Pb).
(ii) Due to consumption of water, specific gravity of H SO is increased.
2 4
(iii) There is arise in voltage. (iv) Energy is absorbed by the cell.
The charging and discharging of the cell can be represented by a single reversible equation given
below :
Pos. Plate Neg. Plate Discharge Pos. Plate Neg. Plate

2 2 4 4 2 4
Charge
For discharge, the equation should be read from left to right and for charge from right to left.
Example 9.8. Estimate the necessary weight of active material in the positive and negative
plates of a lead-acid secondary cell per ampere-hour output (atomic weight of lead 207, valency 2,
E.C.E. of hydrogen 0.0104 × 10 − 6 kg/C).
Solution. Wt. of hydrogen evolved per ampere-hour = 0.0104 × 10
−6
× 3,600
= 37.44 × 10
−6
kg
During discharge, reaction at cathode is Pb + H SO = PbSO + H
2 4 4 2
As seen, 207 kg of lead react chemically to liberate 2 kg of hydrogen.
Hence, weight of Pb needed per ampere-hour = 37.44 × 10
−6
× 207/2 = 3.876 × 10
−3
kg
At anode the reaction is : PbO + H ⎯⎯→ PbO + H O
2 2 2
Atomic weight of PbO = 207 + 32 = 239
2
∴ Wt. of PbO going into combination per ampere-hour = 37.44 × 10 −6 × 239/2 = 4.474 × 10 −−−−−3kg
2
Therefore, quantity of active material required per ampere-hour is : lead 3.876 × 10 −−−−− 3 kg and
lead peroxide 4.474 × 10 −−−−− 3 kg.350 Electrical Technology
9.10. Formation of Plates of Lead-acid Cells
There are, in general, two methods of producing the active materials of the cells and attaching
them to lead plates. These are known after the names of their inventors. (1) Plante plates or formed
plates (2) Faure plates or pasted plates.
9.11. Plante Process
In this process, two sheets of lead are taken and immersed in dilute H SO . When a current is
2 4
passed into this lead-acid cell from a dynamo or some other external source of supply, then due to
electrolysis, hydrogen and oxygen are evolved. At anode, oxygen attacks lead converting it into PbO
2
whereas cathode is unaffected because hydrogen can form on compound with Pb.
If the cell is now discharged (or current is reversed through it), the peroxide-coated plate becomes
cathode, so hydrogen forms on it and combines with the oxygen of PbO to form water thus :
2
PbO + 2H ⎯→ Pb + 2H O
2 2 2
At the same time, oxygen goes to anode (the plate previously unattacked) which is lead and
reacts to form PbO . Hence, the anode becomes covered with a thin film of PbO .
2 2
By continuous reversal of the current or by charging and discharging the above electrolytic cell,
the thin film of PbO will become thicker and thicker and the polarity of the cell will take increasingly
2
longer time to reverse. Two lead plates after being subjected to hundreds of reversals will acquire a
skin of PbO thick enough to possess sufficiently high capacity. This process of making positive
2
plates is known as formation. The negative plates are also made by the same process. They are
turned from positive to negative plates by reversing the current through them until whole PbO is
2
converted into sponge lead. Although Plante positives are very commonly used for stationary work,
Plante negatives have been completely replaced by the Faure or pasted type plates as discussed in
Art. 9.13. However, owing to the length of time required and enormous expenditure of electrical
energy, this process is commercially impracticable. The process of formation can be accelerated by
forming agents such as acetic, nitric or hydrochloric acid or their salts but still this method is expen-
sive and slow and plates are heavy.
9.12. Structure of Plante Plates
It is seen that since active material on a Plante plate consists of a thin layer of PbO formed on
2
and from the surface of the lead plate, it must be made of large superficial area in order to get an
appreciable volume of it. An ordinary lead plate subjected to the forming process as discussed above
will have very small capacity. Its superficial area and hence its capacity, can be increased by groov-
ing or laminating. Fig. 9.6 shows a Plante positive plate which consists of a pure lead grid with finely
laminated surfaces. The construction of these plates consists of a large number of thin vertical lami-
nations which are strengthened at intervals by horizontal binding ribs. This results in an increase of
the superifical area 10 to 12 times that possessed by a plain lead sheet of the same overall dimensions.
The above design makes possible the expansion of the plate structure to accommodate the increase in
mass and the value of the active material (PbO ) which takes place when the cell goes through a series
2
of chemical changes during each cycle of charge or discharge. The expansions of the plate structure
takes place downwards where there is room left for such purpose. Usually, a Plante positive plate
expands by about 10% or so of its length during the course of its useful life.
Another type of Plante positive plate is the ‘rosette’ plate which consists of a perforated cast grid
or framework of lead alloy with 5 to 12 per cent of antimony holding rosettes or spirals of corrugated
pure lead tape. The rosettes (Fig. 9.7) provide the active material of the positive plate and, during
formation, they expand in the holes of the grid which are countersunk on both sides of the grid. The
advantages of such plates are that the lead-antimony grid is itself unaffected by the chemical action
and the complete plate is exceptionally strong.
Other things being equal, the life of a Plante plate is in direct proportion to the weight of lead
metal in it, because as the original layer of PbO slowly crumbles away during the routing charging
2Electrochemical Power Sources 351
and discharging of the cell, fresh active material is formed out of the underlying lead metal. Hence,
the capacity of such a plate lasts as long as the plate itself. In this respect, Plante plate is superior to
the Faure or pasted plate.

9.13. Faure Process
In the making of Faure plates, the active material is mechanically applied instead of being elec-
trochemically produced out of lead plate itself as in Plante process. The active material which is in
the form of red lead (Pb O ) or litharge PbO or the mixture of the two in various proportions, is
3 4
pressed into the interstices of a thin lead grid or lattice work of intersecting ribs which also serves as
conductor of current. The plates after being thus pasted are allowed to dry and harden, are then
assembled in weak solution of H SO of specific gravity 1.1 to 1.2 and are formed by passing an
2 4
electric current between them. If plates are meant to be positive, they are connected up as anodes, if
negative, then as cathodes. The oxygen evolved at the anode converts the lead oxide (Pb O ) into
3 4
peroxide (PbO ) and at cathode the hydrogen reduces PbO to sponge lead by abstracting the oxygen.
2
9.14. Positive Pasted Plates
Formation of positive plate involves converting lead oxide into PbO . A high lead oxide like
2
Pb O is used for economy both in current and time, although in practice, a mixture of Pb O and PbO
3 4 3 4
is taken-the latter being added to assist in the setting or cementation of the plate.
9.15. Negative Pasted Plates
Faure process is much better adopted for making a negative rather than a positive plate. The
negative material i.e. sponge lead is quite tough instead of being hard and brittle like PbO and,
2
moreover, it undergoes a comparatively negligible change in volume during the charging and dis-
charging of the cell. Hence, it has no tendency to disintegrate or shed out of the grid although it does
tend to lose its porosity and become dense and so lose capacity. Hence, in the manufacture of the
pasted negatives, a small percentage of certain substances like powdered pumic or graphite or mag-
nesium sulphate or barium sulphate is added to increase the porosity of the material. If properly
handled, a paste made with H SO , glycerine and PbO (or mixture of PbO and Pb O ) results in a
2 4 3 4
very good negative, because glycerine is carbonised during formation and so helps in keeping the
paste porous.
Faure plates are in more general use because they are cheaper and have a high (capacity/weight)
ratio than Plante plates. Because of the lightness and high capacity/weight ratio, such plates are used352 Electrical Technology
practically for all kinds of portable service like electric vehicles, train lighting, car-lighting and strating
etc. But their life is shorted as compared to Plante plates.
9.16. Structure of Faure Plates
Usually, the problem of Faure type grid is relatively simple as compared to the Plante type. In
the case of Faure plates, the grid serves simply as a support for the active material and a conductor for
the current and as a means for distributing the current evenly over the active material. Unlike Plante
plates, it is not called upon to serve as a kind of reservoir from which fresh active material is continuosly
being formed for replacing that which is lost in the wear and tear of service. Hence, this makes
possible the use of an alloy of lead and antimony which, as pointed out earlier, resists the attack of
acid and ‘forming’ effect of current more effectively than pure lead and is additionally much harder
and stiffer.
Because of the hardening effect of antimony, it is possible to construct very thin light plates
which possess sufficient rigidity to withstand the expensive action of the positive active material.
Simplest type of grid consists of a meshwork of veritcal and horizontal ribs intersecting each other
thereby forming a number of rectangular spaces in which the paste can be pressed and allowed to set.
Such a thin grid has the disadvantage that there is not much to ‘key’ in the paste and due to a great
shock or vibration the pellets are easily ‘started’ and so fall out.
A much better support to the active material can be given by the construction illustrated in Fig.
9.9 which is known as ‘basket’ type or screened grid. The paste instead of being is isolated pellets
forms a continuous sheet contained and supported by the horizontal ribs of the gird. With this ar-
rangement the material can be very effectively keyed in.
Another type of grid structure used in pasted plates is shown in Fig. 9.10.
Fig. 9.9 Fig. 9.10
9.17. Comparison : Plante and Faure Plates
1. Plante plates have a longer life and can withstand rapid discharging (as in traction work)
better than Faure’s.
2. They are less liable to disintegration when in use then Faure’s plates.
3. They are heavier and more expensive than Faure plates.
4. Plante plates have less capacity-to-weight ratio, values being 12 to 21 Ah per kg of plate, the
corresponding values for Faure plate being 65 to 90 Ah/kg.
9.18. Internal Resistance and Capacity of a Cell
The secondary cell possesses internal resistance due to which some voltage is lost in the form of
potential drop across it when current is flowing. Hence, the internal resistance of the cell has to be
kept to the minimum.
One obvious way to lessen internal resistance is to increase the size of the plates. However, thereElectrochemical Power Sources 353
is a limit to this because the cell will
become too big to handle. Hence, in
practice, it is usual to multiply the number
of plate inside the cell and to join all the
negative plates together and all the
positives ones together as shown in Fig.
9.11.
The effect is equivalent to joining
many cells in parallel. At the same time,
the length of the electrolyte between the
electrodes is decreased with a consequent
reduction in the internal resistance.
The ‘capacity’ of a cell is given by
the product of current in amperes and the
Fig. 9.11
time in hours during which the cell can
supply current until its e.m.f. falls to 1.8 volt. It is expressed in ampere-hour (Ah).
The interlacing of plates not only decreases the internal resistance but additionally increases the
capacity of the cell also. There is always one more negative plate than the positive paltes i.e. there is
a negative plate at both ends. This gives not only more mechanical strength but also assures that both
sides of a positive plate are used.
Since in this arrangement, the plates are quite close to each other, something must be done to
make sure that a positive plate does not touch the negative plate otherwise an internal short-circuit
will take place. The separation between the two plates is achieved by using separators which, in the
case of small cells, are made of treated cedar wood, glass, wool mat, microporous rubber and
mocroporous plastic and in the case of large stationary cells, they are in the form of glass rods.
9.19. Two Efficiencies of the Cell
The efficiency of a cell can be considered in two ways :
1. The quantity or ampere-hour (Ah) efficiency
2. The energy or watt-hour (Wh) efficiency
The Ah efficiency does not take into account the varying voltages of charge and discharge. The
Wh efficiency does so and is always less than Ah efficiency because average p.d. during discharging
is less than that during charging. Usually, during discharge the e.m.f. falls from about 2.1 V to
1.8 V whereas during charge it rises from 1.8 volt to about 2.5 V.
amp-hour discharge
Ah efficiency =
amp-hour charge
The Ah efficiency of a lead-acid cell is normally between 90 to 95%, meaning that about
100 Ah must be put back into the cell for every 90-95 Ah taken out of it. Because of gassing which
takes place during the charge, the Ah available for delivery from the battery decreases. It also decreases
(i) due to self-discharge of the plates caused due to local reactions and (ii) due to leakage of current
because of faulty insulation between the cells of the battery.
The Wh efficiency varies between 72-80%.
If Ah efficiency is given, Wh efficiency can be found from the following relation :
average volts on discharge
Wh efficiency = Ah efficiency ×
average volts on charge
From the above, it is clear that anything that increases the charge volts or reduces the discharge
volts will decrease Wh efficiency. Because high charge and discharge rates will do this, hence it is
advisable to avoid these.
9.20. Electrical Characteristics of the Lead-acid Cell
The three important features of an accumulator, of interests to an engineer, are (1) voltage
(2) capacity and (3) efficiency.354 Electrical Technology
1. Voltage
The open-circuit voltage of a
fully-charged cell is approximately
2.2 volt. This value is not fixed but
depends on (a) length of time since
it was last charged (b) specific grav-
ity-voltage increasing with increase
in sp. gravity and vice versa. If sp.
gravity comes near to density of
water i.e. 1.00 then voltage of the
cell will disappear altogether
(c) temperature-voltage increases,
though not much, with increase in
temperature.
The variations in the terminal
p.d. of a cell on charge and discharge Fig. 9.12
are shown in Fig. 9.12. The volt-
age-fall depends on the rate of discharge. Rates of discharge are generally specified by the number of
hours during which the cell will sustain the rate in question before falling to 1.8 V. The voltage falls
rapidly in the beginning (rate of fall depending on the rate of discharge), then vary slowly up to 1.85
and again suddenly to 1.8 V.
The voltage should not be allowed to fall to lower than 1.8 V, otherwise hard insoluble lead
sulphate is formed on the plate which increases the internal resistance of the cell.
The general form of the voltage-time curves corresponding to 1-, 3- 50 and 10- hour rates of
corresponding to the steady currents which
would discharge the cell in the above
mentioned times (in hour). It will be seen that
both the terminal voltage and the rate at which
the voltage and the rate at which the voltage
falls, depend on the rate of discharge. The
more rapid fall in voltage at higher rates of
discharge is due to the rapid increase in the
internal resistance of the cell.
During charging, the p.d. increases (Fig.
9.12). The curve is similar to the discharge
curve reversed but is everywhere higher due
to the increased density of H SO in the pores
2 4
of the positive plate. Fig. 9.13
2. Capacity
It is measured in amp-hours (Ah). The capacity is always given at a specified rate of discharge
(10-hour discharge in U.K., 8-hour discharge in U.S.A.). However, motor-cycle battery capacity is
based on a 20-hour rate (at 30° C). The capacity depends upon the following :
(a) Rate of discharge. The capacity of a cell, as measured in Ah, depends on the discharge rate.
It decreases with increased rate of discharge. Rapid rate of discharge means greater fall in p.d. of the
cell due to internal resistance of the cell. Moreover, with rapid discharge the weakening of the acid in
the pores of the plates is also greater. Hence, the chemical change produced at the plates by 1 ampere
for 10 hours is not the same as produced by 2 A for 5 hours or 4 A for 2.5 hours. It is found that a cell
having a 100 Ah capacity at 10 hour discharge rate, has its capacity reduced to 82.5 Ah at 5-hour rate
and 50 Ah at 1-hour rate. The variation of capacity with discharge rate is shown in Fig. 9.14.Electrochemical Power Sources 355
(b) Temperature. At high temperature,
(i) chemical reactions within the cell
take place more vigorously.
(ii) the resistance of the acid is de-
creased and
(iii) there is a battery diffusion of the
electrolyte.
Hence, high temperature increases the
capacity of the lead-acid cell. Apparently, it is
better to operate the battery at a high tempera-
ture. However, at high temperatures :
(a) the acid attacks the antimony-lead
alloy grid, terminal posts and wooden sepa-
rators.
Fig. 9.14
(b) the paste is rapidly changed into lead
sulphate. Sulphation is always accompanied by expansion of paste particularly at the positive plates
and results in buckling and cracking of the grid.
Hence, it is not advisable to work batteries above 40° C.
As temperature is lowered, the speed of chemical reactions is decreased. Moreover, cell resistance
also increases. Consequently, the capacity of the cell decreases with decrease in temperature till at
freezing point the capacity is reduced to zero even though the battery otherwise be fully charged.
(c) Density of electrolyte. As the density of electrolyte affects the internal resistance and the
vigour of chemical reaction, it has an important effect on the capacity. Capacity increases with the
density.
(d) Quantity of active material. Since production of electricity depends on chemical action
taking place within the cells, it is obvious that the capacity of the battery must depend directly upon
the kind and amount of the active material employed. Consider the following calculations:
The gram-equivalent of lead is 103.6 gram and Faraday’s constant is 96,500 coulombs which is
= 96,500/3600 = 26.8 Ah. Hence, during the delivery of one Ah by the cell, the quantity of lead
expended to form lead sulphate at the negative plate is 103.6/26.8 = 3.86 gram.
Similarly, it can be calculated that, at the same time, 4.46 gram of PbO would be converted into
2
lead sulphate at the positive plate while 3.66 gram of acid would be expended to form 0.672 gram of
water. It is obvious that for obtaining a cell of a greater capacity, it is necessary to provide the plates
with larger amounts of active material.
3. Efficiency
It has already been discussed in Art. 9.19
9.21. Battery Ratings
Following standards have been adopted, both by industry and government organisations to get a
fair picture of battery quantity :
1. Ampere-hour Capacity
It is a function of the total plate area i.e. size of the individual plate multiplied by the number of
plates. For measuring this capacity, the battery is discharged continuously for 20 hours and its current
output supplied to a standard load is measured. Suppose that a battery delivers 4A current for 20
hours. Hence, its rating is 80 Ah which is stamped on the battery case.
2. Reserve Capacity
It is one of the newly-developed rating standards and is more realistic because it provides a
double-check on the Ah figures. The capacity is given by the number of minutes a battery will
tolerate a 25 A drain without dropping below 10.5 V. Higher this rating, better the battery.356 Electrical Technology
3. Zero Cranking Power
It was the first cold weather rating and is applicable in relation to crafts which ply in freezing
weather. This zero-degree performance test gives a valuable insight into battery quality. Large bat-
teries are tested at a 300 A drain with battery chilled to − 18°C (0°F) whereas smaller sizes are tested
at half this value.
This test consists of two part (a) the battery is first chilled to − 18°C (0°F) and the load applied
for 5 second. Meanwhile, the voltage output is recorded. It is the first part of the zero-cranking-
power rating. (b) The test is continued further till voltage drops to 5 V. The number of minutes it
takes to reduce the voltage to 5 V forms the second half of the rating. Higher both the digits, better
the battery quality.
4. Cold Cranking Power
This simple rating is applied to all 12-V storage batteries regardless of their size. The battery is
loaded at − 18°C (0°F) till the total voltage drops to 7.2 V. The output current in amperes is measured
for 30 seconds. Higher the output, better the battery.
Example 9.9. An alkaline cell is discharged at a steady current of 4 A for 12 hours, the average
terminals voltage being 1.2 V. To restore it to its original state of charge, a steady current of 3 A for
20 hours is required, the average terminal voltage being 1.44 V. Calculate the ampere-hour (Ah)
efficiency and Wh efficiency in this particular case.
(Principles of Elect. Engg.-I, Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. As discussed in Art. 9.19
Ah of discharge 12×4
Ah efficiency = = =0.8 or 80%
Ah ofcharge 20×3
Av.volts on discharge 0.8×1.2
Wh efficiency = Ah effi.× = = 0.667 or 66.7%
Av. volts on charge 1.44
Example 9.10. A discharged battery is charged at 8 A for 2 hours after which it is discharged
through a resistor of R Ω. If discharge period is 6 hours and the terminal voltage remains fixed at
12 V, find the value of R assuming the Ah efficiency of the battery as 80%.
Solution. Input amp-hours = 8 × 2 = 16
Efficiency = 0.8 ∴ Ah output 16 × 0.8 = 12.8
Discharge current = 12.8/6 A ∴ R = 12 =
6×12
=5.6 ΩΩΩΩΩ
12.8/6 12.8
9.22. Indications of a Full-charged Cell
The indications of a fully-charged cell are :
(i) gassing (ii) voltage (iii) specific gravity and (iv) colour of the plates.
(i) Gassing
When the cell is fully charged, it freely gives off hydrogen at cathode and oxygen at the anode,
the process being known as “Gassing”. Gassing at both plates indicates that the current is no longer
doing any useful work and hence should be stopped. Moreover, when the cell is fully charged, the
electrolyte assumes a milky appearance.
(ii) Voltage
The voltage ceases to rise when the cell becomes fully-charged. The value of the voltage of a
fully-charged cell is a variable quantity being affected by the rate of charging, the temperature and
specific gravity of the electrolyte etc. The approximate value of the e.m.f. is 2.1 V or so.
(iii) Specific Gravity of the Electrolyte
A third indication of the state of charge of a battery is given by the specific gravity of the electro-
lyte. We have seen from the chemical equations of Art. 9.9, that during discharging , the density of
electrolyte decreases due to other production of water, whereas it increases during charging due to theElectrochemical Power Sources 357
absorption of water. The value of density when the cell is fully charged is 1.21 and 1.18 when
discharged up to 1.8 V. Specific gravity can be measured with a suitable hydrometer which consists
of a float, a chamber for the electrolyte and a squeeze bulb.
(iv) Colour
The colour plates, on full charge is deep chocolate brown for positive plate and clear slate gray
for negative plate and the cell looks quite brisk and alive.
9.23. Applications of Lead-acid Batteries
Storage batteries are these days used for a great variety and range of purposes, some of which are
summarised below :
1. In Central Stations for supplying the whole load during light load periods, also to assist the
generating plant during peak load periods, for providing reserve emergency supply during periods of
plant breakdown and finally, to store energy at times when load is light for use at time when load is at
its peak value.
2. In private generating plants both for industrial and domestic use, for much the same purpose
as in Central Stations.
3. In sub-stations, they assist in maintaining the declared voltage by meeting a part of the
demand and so reducing the load on and the voltage drop in, the feeder during peak-load periods.
4. As a power source for industrial and mining battery locomotives and for road vehicles like
cars and trucks.
5. As a power source for submarines when submerged.
6. Marine applications include emergency or stand-by duties in case of failure of ship’s electric
supply, normal operations where batteries are subjected to regular cycles of charge and discharge and
for supplying low-voltage current to bells, telephones, indicators and warning systems etc.
7. For petrol motor-car starting and ignition etc.
8. As a low voltage supply for operating purposes in many different ways such as high-tension
switchgear, automatic telephone exchange and repeater stations, broadcasting stations and for wireless
receiving sets.
9.24. Voltage Regulators
As explained in Art. 9.20, the voltage of a battery varies
over a considerable range while under discharge. Hence, it is
necessary to find some means to control the battery voltage
upto the end so as to confine variations within reasonable limits
– these limits being supplied by the battery.
The voltage control systems may be hand-operated or
automatic. The simplest form of hand-operated control consists
of a rheostat having a sufficient number of steps so that Fig. 9.15
assistance can be inserted in the circuit when battery is fully charged and gradually cut out as the
discharge continues, as shown in Fig. 9.15.
The above system can be designed for automatic
operation as shown in Fig. 9.16. A rise in voltage
results in the release of pressure on the carbon block
rheostat, thereby increasing its resistance whereas a
fall in voltage results in increasing the pressure on
the block thereby decreasing its resistance. By this
automatic variation of control resistance, variations
in battery voltage are automatically controlled.
9.25. End-cell Control System
The use of rheostat for controlling the battery Fig. 9.16358 Electrical Technology
voltage is objectionable especially in large-
capacity installations where the I2R loss would
be considerable. Hence other more
economical systems have been developed and
put into use. One such system is the end-cell
control system. It consists of suitable regulator
switches which cut one or more of a selected
number of cells out of the circuit when the
battery is fully charged and into the circuit
again as the discharge continues. To make the
process of cutting cells in and out at the battery
circuit simple, the group of cells selected for
Fig. 9.17 this control is situated at one end of the battery
where from it derives the name end cell. By moving the contact arm of the switch to the left or right,
cells are cut in or out of the discharge circuit and so the voltage is varied accordingly.
For making the end-cell switch operate without opening the circuit or shortcircuiting the cells
during its passage from one cell to another, an auxiliary constraint S is employed. S prevents the
2 2
circuit from being open entirely but has sufficient resistance R between it and the main contact arm S
1
to prevent any objectionably large current to flow on short-circuit. The above mechanism usually
incorporates devices for preventing the stoppage of the switch in the short-circuit position.
9.26. Number of End-cells
For maintaining a supply voltage of V volts from a battery of lead-acid cells when the latter are
approaching their discharge voltage of 1.83 (depending on the discharge rate), the number of cells
required is V/1.83. When the battery is fully charged with each cell having an e.m.f. of 2.1 V, then the
number of cells required is V/2.1. Hence, the number of end-cells required is (V/1.83 − V/2.1). These
are connected to a regulating switch which adds them in series with the battery one or two at a time,
as the discharge proceeds.
9.27. Charging Systems
In various installations, batteries are kept floating on the line and are so connected that they are
being charged when load demands are light and automatically discharged during peak periods when
load demands are heavy or when the usual power supply fails or is disconnected. In some other
installations, the battery is connected to the feeder circuit as and when desired, allowed to discharge
to a certain point, then removed and re-charged for further requirements.
For batteries other than the ‘floating’ and ‘system-governed’ type, following two general methods
(though there are some variations of these) are employed.
(i) The Constant-current System and (ii) The Constant-voltage System.
9.28. Constant-current System
In this method, the charging current is kept
constant by varying the supply voltage to over-
come the increased back e.m.f. of cells. If a
charging booster (which is just a shunt dynamo
directly driven by a motor) is used, the current
supplied by it can be kept constant by adjusting
its excitations. If charged on a d.c. supply, the
Fig. 9.18
current is controlled by varying the rheostat con-
nected in the circuit. The value of charging current should be so chosen that there would be noElectrochemical Power Sources 359
excessive gassing during final stages of charging and, also, the cell temperature does not exceed
45°C. This method takes a comparatively longer time.
9.29. Constant-voltage System
In this method, the voltage is kept constant but it results in very large charging current in the
beginning when the back e.m.f. of the cells is low and a small current when their back e.m.f. increases
on being charged.
With this method, time of charging is almost reduced to half. It increases the capacity by
approximately 20% but reduces the efficiency by 10% or so.
Calculations
When a secondary cell or a battery of such cells is being
charged, then the emf of the cells acts in opposition to the
applied voltage. If V is the supply voltage which sends a
charging current of I against the back e.m.f. E , then input is
b
VI but the power spent in overcoming the opposition (Fig. 9.19)
is E I. This power E I is converted into the chemical energy
b b
which is stored in the cell. The charging current can be found
Fig. 9.19
from the following equation :
V − E
I = b
R
where R = total circuit resistance including internal resistance of the battery
I = charging current
By varying R, the charging current can be kept constant throughout.
Example 9.11. A battery of accumulators of e.m.f. 50 volt and internal resistance 2 Ω is charged
on 100 volt direct means. What series resistance will be required to give a charging current of 2 A?
If the price of energy is 50 paise per kWh, what will it cost to charge the battery for 8 hours and
what percentage of energy supplied will be used in the form of heat ?
Solution. Applied voltage = 100 V; Back e.m.f. of the battery = 50 V
Net charging voltage = 100 − 50 = 50 V
Let R be the required resistance, then 2 = 50/(R + 2); R = 46/2 = 23 Ω.
Input for eight hours = 100 × 2 × 8 = 1600 Wh = 1.6 kWh
Cost = 50 × 1.5 = 80 paise; Power wasted on total resistance = 25 × 22 = 100 W
Total input = 100 × 2 = 200 W : Percentage waste = 100 × 100/200 = 50 %
Example 9.12. A 6-cell, 12-V battery is to be charged at a constant rate of 10 A from a 24-V d.c.
supply. If the e.m.f. of each cell at the beginning and end of the charge is 1.9 V and 2.4 V, what
should be the value of maximum resistance to be connected in series with the battery. Resistance of
the battery is negligible.
Solution. Beginning of Charging
Total back e.m.f. of battery = 6 × 1.9 = 11.4 volt
Net driving voltage = 24 − 11.4 = 12.6 V ; R = 12.6/10 = 1.26 ΩΩΩΩΩ
max
End of Charging
Back e.m.f. of battery = 6 × 2.4 = 14.4 volt
Net driving voltage = 24 − 14.4 = 9.6 V; R = 9.6/10 = 0.96 ΩΩΩΩΩ
min360 Electrical Technology
Example 9. 13. Thirty accumulators have to be charged from their initial voltage of 1.8 V using
a direct current supply of 36 volt. Each cell has an internal resistance of 0.02 Ω and can be charged
at 5 amperes. Sketch a circuit by which this can be done, calculating the value of any resistance or
resistances used. What will be the current taken from the mains towards the end of the charging
period when the voltage has risen to 2.1 volt per cell ?
Solution. Since the supply voltage (36 V) is less than
the back e.m.f. of the 30 cell battery (54 V), hence the cells
are divided into two equal groups and placed in parallel across
the supply for charging as shown in Fig. 9.20. It would be
economical to use a separate resistance R in series with each
group.
Here V = 36 V, E = 15 × 1.8 = 27 V
b
Internal resistance of each parallel group
= 15 × 0.02 = 0.3 Ω

Charging current = 5A ∴ 5 =
R + 0.3
R = 1.5 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Now,when the voltage per cell becomes 2.1 V, then back

e.m.f. of each parallel group = 15 × 2.1 = 31.5 V
36 −31.5
∴ Charging current = = 2.5 A
1.5 + 0.3
Example 9.14. A battery of 60 cells is charged from a supply of 250 V. Each cell has an e.m.f.
of 2 volts at the start of charge and 2.5 V at the end. If internal resistance of each cell is 0.1 Ω and
if there is an external resistance of 19 Ω in the circuit, calculate (a) the initial charging current
(b) the final charging current and (c) the additional resistance which must be added to give a finish-
ing charge of 2 A rate.
Solution. (a) Supply voltage V = 250 V
Back e.m.f. of the battery E at start = 60 × 2 = 120 V and
b
at the end = 60 × 2.5 = 150 V
Internal resistance of the battery = 60 × 0.1 = 6 Ω
Total circuit resistance = 19 + 6 = 25 Ω
(a) Net charging voltage at start = 250 − 120 = 130 V
∴ Initial charging current = 130/25 = 5.2 A
Fig. 9.21
(b) Final charging current = 100/25 = 4 A
(c) Let R be the external resistance, then
2 = 100 ∴ R = 88/2 = 44 Ω
R + 6
∴ Additional resistance required = 44 − 19 = 25 ΩΩΩΩΩ.
Example 9.15. Two hundred and twenty lamps of 100 W each are to be run on a battery supply
at 110 V. The cells of the battery when fully charged have an e.m.f. of 2.1 V each and when dis-
charged 1.83 V each. If the internal resistance per cell is 0.00015 Ω (i) find the number of cells in
the battery and (ii) the number of end cells. Take the resistance of the connecting wires as 0.005 Ω.
Solution. Current drawn by lamps = 220 × 100/110 = 200 A
Voltage drop on the resistance of the connecting wires = 0.005 × 200 = 1.0 V
Battery supply voltage = 110 + 1 = 111 VElectrochemical Power Sources 361
Terminal voltage/cell when fully charged and
supplying the load
= 2.1 − (200 × 0.00015) = 2.08 V
Terminal voltage/cell when discharged
= 1.83 − (200 × 0.00015) = 1.8 V
(i) No. of cells in the battery = 111/2.08
= 53.4 say, 54
(ii) No. of cells required when discharged
= 111/1.8 = 62
Hence, number of end cells = 62 − 54 = 8
Fig. 9.22
The connections are shown in Fig. 9.22.
Example 9.16. A storage battery consists of 55 series-connected cells each of internal resistance
0.001 Ω and e.m.f. 2.1 V. Each cell consists of 21 plates, ten positive and eleven negative, each plate
measuring 20 × 25 cm. If full-load current per cell is 0.01 A per cm2 of positive plate surface, find
(i) full-load terminal voltage of the battery and (ii) power wasted in the battery if the connectors
have a total resistance of 0.025 Ω.
Solution. Since both sides of a positive plate are utilized, the area of both sides will be taken into
consideration.
Total area (both sides) of ten positive plates = 2 × 20 × 25 × 10 = 10,000 cm2
Full load current = 10,000 × 0.01 = 100 A
Voltage drop in battery and across connectors = 100 [(55 × 0.001) + 0.025] = 8 V
Battery e.m.f. = 55 × 1.2 = 115.5 V
(i) Battery terminal voltage on full-load = 115.5 − 8 = 107.5 V
(ii) Total resistance = (55 × 0.001) + 0.025 = 0.08 Ω; Power loss = 1002 × 0.08 = 800 W.
Example 9.17. A charging booster (shunt generator) is to charge a storage battery of 100 cells
each of internal resistance 0.001 Ω. Terminal p.d. of each cell at completion of charge is 2.55 V.
Calculate the e.m.f. which the booster must generate to give a charging current of 20 A at the end of
charge. The armature and shunt field resistances of the generator are 0.2 and 258 Ω respectively
and the resistance of the cable connectors is 0.05 Ω.
Solution. Terminal p.d. per cell = 2.55 volt
The charging voltage across the battery must be
capable of overcoming the back e.m.f. and also to supply
the voltage drop across the internal resistance of the
battery.
Back e.m.f. = 100 × 2.55 = 255 V
Voltage drop on internal resistance
= 100 × 0.001 × 20 = 2 V
∴ P.D. across points A and B = 255 + 2 = 257 V Fig. 9.23
P.D. across terminals C and D of the generator
= 257 + (20 × 0.05) = 258 V
∴ I = 258/258 = 1A; I = 20 + 1 = 21 A

[(i) 107.5 V (ii) 800 W]
9.30. Trickle Charging
When a storage battery is kept entirely as an emergency reserve, it is very essential that it should
be found fully charged and ready for service when an emergency arises. Due to leakage action and
other open-circuit losses, the battery deteriorates even when idle or on open-circuit. Hence, to keep
it fresh, the battery is kept on a trickle charge. The rate of trickle charge is small and is just sufficient
to balance the open-circuit losses. For example, a standby battery for station bus-bars capable of
giving 2000 A for 1 hour or 400 Ah at the 10-hr rate, will be having a normal charging rate of
555 A, but a continuous ‘trickle’ charge of 1 A or so will keep the cells fully charged (without any
gassing) and in perfect condition. When during an emergency, the battery gets discharged, it is
recharged at its normal charging rate and then is kept on a continuous trickle charge.
9.31. Sulphation-Causes and Cure
If a cell is left incompletely charged or is not fully charged periodically, then the lead sulphate
formed during discharge, is not converted back into PbO and Pb. Some of the unreduced PbSO
2 4
which is left, gets deposited on the plates which are then said to be sulphated. PbSO is in the form of
4
minute crystals which gradually increase in size if not reduced by thoroughly charging the cells. It
increases the internal resistance of the cell thereby reducing its efficiency and capacity. Sulphation
also sets in if the battery is overcharged or left discharged for a long time.
Sulphated cells can be cured by giving them successive overcharges, for which purpose they are
cut out of the battery during discharge, so that they can get two charges with no intervening discharge.
The other method, in which sulphated cells need not be cut out of the battery, is to continue charging
them with a ‘milking booster’ even after the battery as a whole has been charged. A milking booster
is a motor-driven low-voltage dynamo which can be connected directly across the terminals of the
sulphated cells.
9.32. Maintenance of Lead-acid Cells
The following important points should be kept in mind for keeping the battery in good condition:
1. Discharging should not be prolonged after the minimum value of the voltage for the particu-
lar rate of discharge is reached.
2. It should not be left in discharged condition for long.
3. The level of the electrolyte should always be 10 to 15 mm above the top of the plates which
must not be left exposed to air. Evaporation of electrolyte should be made up by adding
distilled water occasionally.
4. Since acid does not vaporise, none should be added.Electrochemical Power Sources 363
5. Vent openings in the filling plug should be kept open to prevent gases formed within from
building a high pressure.
6. The acid and corrosion on the battery top should be washed off with a cloth moistened with
baking soda or ammonia and water.
7. The battery terminals and metal supports should be cleaned down to bare metal and covered
with vaseline or petroleum jelly.
9.33. Main Operated Battery Chargers
A battery charger is an electrical device that is used for putting energy into a battery. The battery
charger changes the a.c. from the power line into d.c. suitable for charger. However, d.c. generator
and alternators are also used as charging sources for secondary batteries.
In general, a mains-operated battery charger consists of the following elements :
1. A step-down transformer for reducing the high a.c. mains voltage to a low a.c. voltage.
2. A half-wave or full-wave rectifier for converting alternating current into direct current.
3. A charger-current limiting element for preventing the flow of excessive charging current
into the battery under charge.
4. A device for preventing the reversal of current i.e. discharging of the battery through the
charging source when the source voltage happens to fall below the battery voltage.
In addition to the above, a battery charger may also have circuitry to monitor the battery voltage
and automatically adjust the charging current. It may also terminate the charging process when the
battery becomes fully charged. However, in many cases, the charging process is not totally termi-
nated but only the charging rate is reduced so as to keep the battery on trickle charging. These
requirements have been illustrated in Fig. 9.24.
Most of the modern battery chargers are fully protected against the following eventualities :
(a) They are able to operate into a short-circuit.
(b) They are not damaged by a reverse-connected battery.
(c) They are operated into a totally flat battery.
(d) They can be regulated both for current and voltage.
Fig. 9.24
9.34. Car Battery Charger Using SCR
Fig. 9.25 shows the circuitry of a very simple lead-acid battery charger which has been provided364 Electrical Technology
protection from load short-circuit and from reverse battery polarity. The SCR is used as a half-wave
rectifier as well as switching element to terminate the high-current charging process when battery gets
fully-charged.
Working
The SCR acts as a half-wave rectifier during only the positive half-cycles of the secondary volt-
age when point M in Fig. 9.25 is at a positive potential. The SCR does not conduct during the
negative half-cycle of the secondary voltage when point M achieves negative potential. When M is at
positive potential, the SCR is triggered into conduction because of the small gate current I passing
g
via R and diode D . In this way, the charging current I after passing through R enters the battery
1 1 5
which is being charged.
In the initial state, when the battery voltge is low, the potential of point A is also low (remember
that R , R and preset resistor R are connected across the battery via R ) which means that the
3 4 6 5
forward bias on the base of transistor T is not sufficient to make it conduct and thereby stop the
conduction of SCR. Hence, SCR keeps conducting , consequently, keeps charging the battery through
the current limiting resistor R .
5
Fig. 9.25
As the battery gets progressively charged, its voltage rises and when it becomes fully charged,
the potential of point A increases thereby increasing the forward bias of T which starts conducting. In
that case, T bypasses the triggering gate current of the SCR via R and D . Since the SCR can no
1 3
longer be triggered, the charging process stops. However, a small trickle charging current keeps
flowing via. R and D . The function of diode D is to prevent reverse flow of the current through the
2 2 2
battery when point M has negative potential during the negative cycle of the secondary voltage. The
value of trickle charging current is determined by R because R has a fixed but small value. The
2 5
resistor R also limits the flow of excessive charging current when the charger is connected to a
5
completely dead battery.
The charger described above is not suitable for fast charging because it utilizes half-wave recti-
fication. Most of the mains-operated chargers working on a single-phase supply use a full-wave
rectifier consisting of a center-tapped tarnsformer and two diodes or a bridge circuit using for diodes.
9.35. Automobile Battery Charger Using Full-wave Rectifier
The battery charger shown in Fig. 9.26, is used to recharge run-down lead-acid batteries in
automobiles without removing them from their original mountings and without any need for constant
attention. When the battery is fully charged, the circuit automatically switches from charging current
to trickle charging and an indicator lamp lights up to provide a visual indication of this condition.Electrochemical Power Sources 365
As shown in Fig. 9.26, diodes D , and D form a full-wave rectifier to provide pulsating direct
1 2
current for charging the battery. The battery is charged through the SCR which is also used as switch
to terminate the charging process when the battery becomes fully charged. The two transistors T and
1
T together form an electronic switch that has two stable states i.e. the ON state in which T and T
2 1 2
conduct and the OFF state in which T and T do not conduct. The ON-OFF state of this switch is
1 2
decided by the battery voltage and setting of the “current adjust” potentiometer R .
6
Fig. 9.26
Working
When switch S is turned on, the full-wave rectified output of D and D charges capacitor C
1 2
through R , lamp L and R . In a very short time, capacitor voltage rises high enough to make diode D
1 2 3
conduct the gate current thereby triggering SCR into conduction during each half-cycle of the output
voltage. Hence, full charging current is passed through the cathode K of the SCR to the positive
terminal of the battery whose negative terminal is connected directly to the center tap of the step-
down transformer. Resistor R limits the charging current to a safe value in order to protect the
1
rectifier diodes D and D in case the load happens to be a “dead” battery.
1 2
When the battery is being charged and has low voltage, the two transistors T and T remain in
1 2
the non-conducting state. However, when the battery voltage rises and finally the battery becomes
fully-charged, the two transistors T and T (which form a regenerative switch) are triggered into
1 2
conduction at a point set by R . In this way, T and T provide a low-impedance discharge path for C.
6 1 2
Hence, C discharges through R and the T − T switch, thereby cutting off the gate current of the SCR
2 1 2
which stops conducting thereby terminating the battery charge. Thereafter, small trickle charge cur-
rent keeps on flowing into the battery via L and the regenerative switch formed by T and T . A
1 2
glowing lamp L indicates that the battery is under trickle charging.
Fig. 9.27 shows the same circuit as shown in Fig. 9.26 except that the two-diode full-wave recti-
fier has been replaced by a full-wave bridge rectifier using four diodes.

9.36. Static Uninterruptable Power Systems (UPS)
The function of a UPS is to ensure absolute continuity of power to the computerised control
systems thereby protecting critical equipment from electrical supply failure. A UPS makes it pos-
sible to provide a ‘clean’ reliable supply of alternating current free of sags of surges in the line
voltage, frequency variation, spikes and transients. UPS systems achieve this by rectifying the stan-
dard mains supply, using the direct current to charge the standby battery and to produce ‘clean’
alternating current by passing through an inverter and filter system.
Components of a UPS System
The essential components of a UPS system as shown in Fig. 9.28 are as under :
1. A rectifier and thyristor-controlled battery charger which converts the AC input into regulated
DC output and keeps the standby battery fully charged.
2. A standby battery which provides DC input power to inverter during voltage drops or on
failure of the normal mains AC supply.
3. An inverter which converts DC to clean AC thus providing precisely regulated output voltage
and frequency to the load as shown.
Working
As shown in Fig. 9.28 the main flow of energy is from the rectifier to the inverter with the standby
battery kept on ‘float’. If the supply voltage falls below a certain level or fails completely, the battery
output to the inverter maintains a clean a.c. supply. When the mains power supply is resorted, the main
energy flow against starts from the rectifier to the inverter but, in addition, the rectifier recharges the
battery. When the standby battery gets fully charged, the charging current is automatically throttled
back due to steep rise in the back e.m.f. of the battery . An automatic/manual bypass switch is used to
connect the load either directly to the mains a.c. supply or to the inverter a.c. supply.
Fig. 9.28
Depending on the application, the voltage of the UPS standby battteries may be anywhere between
12 V and 400 V. Typical values are 24 V, 48 V, 110 V and 220 V with currents ranging from a few
amperes to 2000 A. Fig. 9.28 shows Everon 4-kVA on-line UPS system which works on 170 V-270
V a.c. input and provides an a.c. output voltage of 230 V at 50 Hz frequency with a voltage stability
of ± 2% and frequency stability of ± 1%. It has zero change over time and has audio beeper which
indicates mains fail and battery discharge. It provides 100% protection against line noise, spikes,
surges and radio frequency interference. It is manufactured by Everon Electro Systems Pvt. Ltd. New
Delhi.
9.37. Alkaline Batteries
Such batteries are ideally suited for portable work. Like lead-acid cells, the alkaline cells also
consist of positive and negative plates immersed in an electrolyte. The plates and the electrolyte are
placed in a suitable-container.
The two types of alkaline batteries which are in general use are :
(i) nickel-iron type of Edison type.
(ii) nickel-cadmium type of Jungnor type which is commercially known as NIFE battery.Electrochemical Power Sources 367
Fig. 9.29
Another alkaline battery which differs from the above only in the mechanical details of its plates
is known as Alkum battery which uses nickel hydroxide and graphite in the positive plates and a
powdered alloy of iron and chromium in the negative plates.
Silver-zinc type of alkaline batteries are also made whose active material for the positive plate is
silver oxide (Ag O) and for negative plate is zinc oxide and zinc powder. The electrodes or plates of
2
the alkaline cells are designed to be either of the enclosed-pocket type or open-pocket type. In the
case of enclosed-pocket type plates, the active material is inside perforated metal envelopes whereas
in the other type, the active material is outside directly in contact with the electrolyte. As shown in
Fig. 9.29, the active material of the enclosed-pocket type plates is enclosed in nickel-plated perfo-
rated steel pockets or packs which are pressed into the steel frames of the plates.
The open-pocket type plates are made of the following three materials :
(i) metal-ceramic plate-the frame of the plate is a nickel-plated steel grid with the active mate-
rial pressed in under a pressure of 800 to 1900 kg/cm2.
(ii) foil plate-the base of such a plate is a thin nickel foil coated with a layer of nickel suspension
deposited by a spray technique.
(iii) pressed plates–the base member of these plates is a nickel–plated pressed steel grid. The
active material is pressed into them at a pressure of about 400 kg/cm2.
9.38. Nickel-iron and Edison Batteries
There is revived interest in the nickel-iron battery because it seems to be one of the few systems
which may be developed into a high-energy density battery for electric vehicles. Since long the two
main designs for this battery have been the tubular positive type and the flat pocket plate type although
cells with sintered type negative are also being manufactured.
The active materials in a nickel-iron cell are :
(i) Nickel hydroxide Ni(OH) or apple green nickel peroxide NiO for the positive plate. About
4 2
17 per cent of graphite is added to increase conductivity. It also contains an activating additive
barium hydroxide which is about 2 per cent of the active material. This additive increases the service
life of the plates.368 Electrical Technology

4–plates side members. 5–ebonite spacer sticks. 6–pockets.
(ii) powdered iron and its oxides for the negative plate. Small quantities of nickel sulphate and
ferrous sulphide are added to improve the performance of the coil.
(iii) the electrolyte is 21 per cent solution of caustic potash KOH (potassium hydrate) to which is
added a small quantity of lithium hydrate LiOH for increasing the capacity of the cell.
As shown in Fig. 9.30, plates of the same polarity with their pockets filled, are assembled into
cells groups for which purpose they are welded to a common strap having a threaded post.
The number of negative plates is one more than the positive plates. The extreme negative plates
are electrically connected to the container. Ebonite separating sticks are placed between the positive
and negative plates to prevent any short-circuiting.
The steel containers of the batteries are press-formed from steel and the joints are welded. The
body and the cover are nickel-plated and have a dull finish. However, it should be kept in mind that
since these containers are electrically alive, no loose wires should touch them owing to the danger of
severe sparking from short-circuits.
9.39.Chemical Changes
The exact nature of the chemical changes taken place in such a cell is not clearly understood
because the exact formula for the nickel oxide is not yet well established but the action of the cell can
be understood by assuming the peroxide NiO or its hydrated form Ni(OH) .
2 4
First, let us assume that at positive plate, nickel oxide is in its hydrate form Ni(OH) . During
4
discharge, electrolyte KOH splits up into positive K ions and negative OH ions. The K ions go to
anode and reduce Ni(OH) to NI(OH) . The OH ions travel towards the cathode and oxidise iron.
4 2
During charging, just the opposite reactions take place i.e. K ions go to cathode and OH ions go to
anode. The chemical reactions can be written thus :
KOH ⎯⎯→ K + OHElectrochemical Power Sources 369
During discharge
Positive plate : Ni(OH) + 2 K ⎯⎯→ Ni(OH) + 2 KOH
4 2
Negative plate : Fe + 2 OH ⎯⎯→ Fe(OH)
2
During Charging
Positive plate : Ni(OH) + 2OH ⎯⎯→ Ni(OH)
2 4
Negative plate : Fe(OH) + 2K ⎯⎯→ Fe + 2 KOH
2
The charging and discharging can be represented by a single reversible equation thus :
Pos. Plate Neg. Plate Discharge Pos. Plate Neg. Plate
Ni(OH) + KOH + Fe Ö Ni(OH) + KOH + Fe(OH)
4 2 2
Charge
It will be observed from the above equation that as no water is formed, there is no overall change
in the strength of the electrolyte. Its function is merely to serve as a conductor of as a vehicle for the
transfer of OH ions from one plate to another. Hence, the specific gravity of the electrolyte remains
practically constant, both during charging and discharging. That is why only a small amount of
electrolyte is required which fact enables the cells to be small in bulk.
Note. If, however, we assume the nickel oxide to be in the form NiO , then the above reactions can be

represented by the following reversible equation :

9.40. Electrical Characteristics
The e.m.f. of an Edison cell, when fully charged, is nearly 1.4 V which decreases rapidly to
1.3 V and then try slowly on 1.1 or 1.0 V on discharge. The average discharge voltage for a 5-hour
discharge rate is 1.2 V. Hence, for the same average value of the voltage, an alkali accumulator will
consist of 1.6 to 1.7 times as many cells as in a lead-acid battery. Internal resistance of an alkali cell
is nearly five times that of the lead-acid cell, hence there is a relatively greater difference between its
terminal voltage when charging and discharging.
The average charging voltage for an alkali cell is about 1.7 V. The general shapes of the charge
and discharge curves for such cells are, however, similar to those for lead-acid cells. The rated
capacity of nickel accumulators usually refers to either 5-hour or 8-hour discharge rate unless stated
otherwise.
The plates of such cells have greater mechanical strength because of all-steel construction. They
are comparatively lighter because (i) their plates are lighter and (ii) they require less quantity of
electrolyte. They can withstand heavy charge and discharge currents and do not deteriorate even if
left discharged for long periods.
Due to its relatively higher internal resistance, the efficiencies of an Edison cell are power than
those of the lead acid cell. On the average, its Ah efficiency is about 80% and Wh efficiency 60 or
50%. It has an average density of 50 Wh/kg.
With increase in temperature, e.m.f. is increased slightly but capacity increases by an appre-
ciable amount. With decrease in temperature, the capacity decreases becoming practically zero at
4°C even through the cell is fully charged. This is serious drawback in the back in the case of
electrically driven vehicles in cold weather and previous have to be taken to heat up the battery before
starting, though, in practice, the I2 R loss in the internal resistance of the battery is sufficient to keep
the battery cells warm when running.
The principal disadvantage of the Edison battery on nickel-iron battery is its high initial cost
(which will probably be sufficiently reduced when patents expire). At present, an Edison battery
costs approximately twice as much as a lead-acid battery designed for similar service. But since the
alkaline battery outlasts an indeterminate number of lead-acid batteries, it is cheaper in the end.370 Electrical Technology
Because of their lightness, compact construction, increased mechanical strength, ability to with-
stand rapid charging and discharging without injury and freedom from corrosive liquids and fumes,
alkaline batteries are ideally suited for traction work such as propulsion of electric factory trucks,
mine locomotives, miner’s lamps, lighting and starting of public service vehicles and other services
involving rough usage etc.

9.41. Nickel-Cadmium Batteries
6
7
The reactive materials in a nickel-cadmium
8
cell (Fig. 9.31) are :
(i) Ni(OH) 4 for the positive plate exactly 4 9
as in the nickel-iron cell.
(ii) a mixture of cadmium or cadmium 3 10
oxide and iron mass to which is added about 3
2 11
per cent of solar oil for stabilizing the electrode
capacity. The use of cadmium results in 1
reduced internal resistance of the cell.
(iii) the electrolyte is the same as in the
nickel-iron cell.
The cell grouping and plate arrangement
is identical with nickel-iron batteries except that
the number of positive plates is more than the
negative plates. Such batteries are more suit-
able than nickel-iron batteries for floating du-
ties in conjunction with a charging dynamo be-
cause, in their case, the difference between
charging and discharging e.m.f.s is not as great
as in nickel-iron batteries.
Nickel-cadmium sintered plate batteries
were first manufactured by Germans for mili-
tary aircrafts and rockets. Presently, they are
available in a variety of designs and sizes and

teries have very low open-circuit losses, they
are well-suited for pleasure yatches and launches which may be laid up for long periods. They are
also used in commercial airliners, military aeroplanes and helicopters for starting main engines or
auxiliary turbines and for emergency power supply.
9.42. Chemical Changes
The chemical changes are more or less similar to those taking place in nickel-iron cell. As
before, the electrolyte is split up into positive K ions and negative OH ions. The chemical reactions
at the two plates are as under :
During discharge
Positive plate : Ni(OH) + 2K = Ni(OH) + 2 KOH
4 2
Negative plate : Cd + 2 OH = Cd (OH)
2
During Charging
Positive plate : Ni(OH) + 2OH = Ni(OH)
2 4
Negative plate : Cd(OH) + 2 K = Cd + 2 KOH

The above reaction can be represented by the following reversible equation :

Moreover, as copmpared to lead-acid, the alkaline cells operate much better at low temperature,
do not emit obnoxious fumes, have very small self-discharge and their plates do not buckle or smell.
9.44. Silver-Zinc Batteries
The active material of the positive plates is silver oxide which is pressed into the plate and then
subjected to a heat treatment. The active material of the negative plates is a mixture of zinc powder
and zinc oxide.
The chemical changes taking place within the cell can be represented by the following single
equation :
+ ve plate − ve plate discharge + ve plate −ve plate
Ag O + Zn Ö 2 Ag + ZnO
2
Charge
A silver-zinc cell has a specific capacity (i.e. capacity per unit weight) 4 to 5 times greater than
that of other type of cells. Their ground applications are mainly military i.e. communications equip-
ment, portable radar sets and night-vision equipment. Moreover, comparatively speaking, their effi-
ciency is high and self-discharge is small. Silver-zinc batteries can withstand much heavier discharge
currents than are permissible for other types and can operate over a temperature range of − 20° C to
+ 60°C. Hence, they are used in heavy – weight torpedoes and for submarine propulsion. It has
energy density of 150 Wh/kg. Its life time in wet condition is 1-2 years and the dry storage life is upto
5 years. However, the only disadvantage of silver-zinc battery or cell is its higher cost.
9.45. High Temperature Batteries
It is a new group of source which requires operating temperatures above the embient. They
possess the advantages of high specific energy and power coupled with low cost. They are particu-
larly suitable for vehicle traction and load levelling purpose in the electric supply industry. We will
beiefly describe the following cell from which high-temperature batteries are made.372 Electrical Technology
1. Lithium/Chlorine Cell
It has an emf of 3.5 V, a theoretical specific energy of 2200 Wh/kg at 614°C and operating
temperature of 650°C.
2. Lithium/Sulphur Cell
It has an emf of 2.25 V, specific energy of 2625 Wh/kg and an operating temperature of 365°C.
3. Lithium-Aluminium/Iron-Sulphide Cells
The emf of these cells is 1.3 V and a theoretical specific energy of 450 Wh/kg.
4. Sodium/Sulphur Cells
It utilises liquid sodium as negative electrode and sulphur as positive electrode and employs
polycrystalline beta alumina as solid electrolyte. It was conceived in the 1960s by J.T. Kummer and
N. Weber. The cell reaction can be written as 2 Na + 3 S = Na S . The announcement of sodium/
2 3
sulphur battery based on beta alumina was made by Ford Motor Company of USA in 1966. The
open-circuit voltage of the cell is 2.1 V and it has a specific energy of 750 Wh/kg with an operating
temperature of 350°C. The two unique features of this cell are (1) a Faradaic efficiency of 100% and
an ampere-hour capacity which is invariant with discharge rate and (2) high self-life (which is critical
for certain space applications).
9.46. Secondary Hybrid Cells
A hybrid cell may be defined as a galvanic electrotechnical generator in which one of the active
reagents is in the gaseous state i.e. the oxygen of the air. Such cells take advantage of both battery and
fuel cell technology. Examples of such cells are :
1. Metal-air cells such as iron oxygen and zinc oxygen cells.
The Zn/O cell has an open-circuit voltage of 1.65 V and a theoretical energy density of 1090
2
Wh/kg. The Fe/O cell has an OCV of 1.27 V and energy density of 970 Wh/kg.
2
2. Metal-halogen cells such as zinc-chlorine and zinc-bromine cells.
The zinc-chlorine cell has an OCV of 2.12 V at 25°C and a theoretical energy density of 100 Wh/
kg. Such batteries are being developed for EV and load levelling applications. The zinc-bromine cell
has an OCV of 1.83 V at 25°C and energy density of 400 Wh/kg.
3. Metal-hydrogen cells such as nickel-hydrogen cell.
Such cells have an OCV of 1.4 V and a specific energy of about 65 Wh/kg. Nickel-hydrogen
batteries have captured large share of the space battery market in recent years and are rapidly replac-
ing Nickel/cadmium batteries as the energy storage system of choice. They are acceptable for geo-
synchronous orbit applications where not many cycles are required over the life of the system (1000
cycles, 10 years).
The impetus for research and development of metal-air cells has arisen from possible EV appli-
cations where energy density is a critical parameter. An interesting application suggested for a sec-
ondary zinc-oxygen battery is for energy storage on-board space craft where the cell could be in-
stalled inside one of the oxygen tanks thereby eliminating need for gas supply pipes and valves etc.
These cells could be reacharged using solar converters.
Some of the likely future developments for nickel-hydrogen batteries are (1) increase in cycle
life for low earth orbit applications upto 40,000 cycles (7 years) (2) increase in the specific energy
upto 100 W/kg for geosynchronous orbit applications and
(3) development of a bipolar nickel-hydrogen battery for high
pulse power applications.
9.47. Fuel Cells
As discussed earlier, a secondary battery produces electric
current by oxidation-reduction chemical reaction. Similar
chemical reactions take place in fuel cells but there is a basic
Fuel Cells
difference between the two. Whereas in secondary batteries theElectrochemical Power Sources 373
chemical energy is stored in the positive and negative electrodes, in fuel cells the oxidant and the fuel
are stored outside the cells and must be fed to the electrodes continuously during the time the fuel cell
supplies electric current. This gives an advantage to the fuel cells over the storage battery because
fuels can be quickly replenished which is similar to filling up to the petrol tank of a car. Moreover,
storage batteries when fully discharged take several hours to be recharged.
9.48. Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cells
The first fuel battery was designed by F.T.
Bacon in 1959. The construction of a simple
fuel cell is shown in Fig. 9.32. The electrodes
are made from sintered nickel plates having a
coarse pore surface and a fine pore surface, the
two surfaces being for gas and electrolyte respec-
tively. The electrolyte used in KOH is of about
85 per cent concentration. The water vapour
formed as a byproduct of the reaction is removed
by condensation from the stream of hydrogen
passing over the back of the fuel.
The two electrodes of the fuel cell are fed
Fig. 9.32
with a continuous stream of hydrogen and oxy-
gen (or air) as shown. The oxygen and hydrogen ions react with the potassium hydroxide electrolyte
at the surface of the electrodes and produce water. The overall cell reaction is
2H + O = 2H O
2 2 2
The basic reaction taking place in the cells are shown in more details in the Fig. 9.32.
Fuel cell batteries have been used in the manned Apollo space mission for on-board power
supply and also for power supply in unmanned satellites and space probes. These batteries have also
been used for tractors, fork-lift trucks and golf carts etc. Research is being carried out to run these
batteries with natural gas and alcohol. Fuel cell systems are particularly useful where electrical
energy is required for long periods. Such applications include (1) road and rail traction (2) industrial
trucks (3) naval craft and submarine (4) navigational aids and radio repeater stations etc.
9.49. Batteries for Aircraft
The on-board power requirements in aircraft have undergone many changes during the last three
or four decades. The jet engines of the aircraft which require starting currents of about 1000 A,
impose a heavy burden on the batteries. However, these days this load is provided by small
turbogenerator sets and since batteries are needed only to start them, the power required is much less.
These batteries possess good high-rate capabilities in order to supply emergency power for upto 1 h
in the event of the generator failure. However, their main service is as a standby power for miscella-
neous on-board equipment. Usually, batteries having 12 cells (of a nominal voltage of 24 V) with
capacities of 18 and 34 Ah at the 10 h rate are used. In order to reduce weight, only light-weight high-
impact polystyrene containers and covers are used and the cells are fitted with non-spill ventplugs to
ensure complete unspillability in any aircraft position during aerobatics. Similarly, special plastic
manifolds are moulded into the covers to provide outlet for gases evolved during cycling.
9.50. Batteries for Submarines
These batteries are the largest units in the traction service. In older types of submarines, the lead
storage battery was the sole means of propulsion when the submarine was fully submerged and,
additionally supplied the ‘hotel load’ power for lights, instruments and other electric equipment.
When the introduction of the snorkel breathing tube made it possible to use diesel engines for propul-
sion, battery was kept in reserve for emergency use only. Even modern nuclear-powered submarines
use storage batteries for this purpose. These lead-acid batteries may be flat, pasted plate or tubular374 Electrical Technology
positive plate type with 5 h capacities ranging from 10,000 to 12,000 Ah. One critical requirement
for this service is that the rate of evolution of hydrogen gas on open-circuit should not exceed the
specified low limit.
Double plate separation with the help of felted glass fibre mats and microscoporous separators is
used in order to ensure durability, high performance and low standing losses.

10.1. Absolute and Secondary Instruments
The various electrical instruments may, in a very broad sense,
be divided into (i) absolute instruments and (ii) secondary
instruments. Absolute instruments are those which give the
value of the quantity to be measured, in terms of the constants
of the instrument and their deflection only. No previous
calibration or comparision is necessary in their case. The example
of such an instrument is tangent galvanometer, which gives the
value of current, in terms of the tangent of deflection produced
by the current, the radius and number of turns of wire used and
the horizontal component of earth’s field.
Secondary instruments are those, in which the value of
An absolute instrument
electrical quantity to be measured can be determined from the
deflection of the instruments, only when they have been pre-
calibrated by comparison with an absolute instrument. Without calibration, the deflection of such
instruments is meaningless.
It is the secondary instruments, which are most generally used in everyday work; the use of the
absolute instruments being merely confined within laboratories, as standardizing instruments.
10.2. Electrical Principles of Operation
All electrical measuring instruments depend for their action on one of the many physical effects
of an electric current or potential and are generally classified according to which of these effects is
utilized in their operation. The effects generally utilized are :
1. Magnetic effect - for ammeters and voltmeters usually.
2. Electrodynamic effect - for ammeters and voltmeters usually.
3. Electromagnetic effect - for ammeters, voltmeters, wattmeters and watthour meters.
4. Thermal effect - for ammeters and voltmeters.
5. Chemical effect - for d.c. ampere-hour meters.
6. Electrostatic effect - for voltmeters only.
Another way to classify secondary instruments is to divide them into (i) indicating instruments
(ii) recording instruments and (iii) integrating instruments.
Indicating instruments are those which indicate the instantaneous value of the electrical quantity
being measured at the time at which it is being measured. Their indications are given by pointers
moving over calibrated dials. Ordinary ammeters, voltmeters and wattmeters belong to this class.
Recording instruments are those, which, instead of indicating by means of a pointer and a scale
the instantaneous value of an electrical quantity, give a continuous record or the variations of such a
quantity over a selected period of time. The moving system of the instrument carries an inked pen
which rests lightly on a chart or graph, that is moved at a uniform and low speed, in a direction
perpendicular to that of the deflection of the pen. The path traced out by the pen presents a continu-
ous record of the variations in the deflection of the instrument.
Integrating instruments are those which measure and register by a set of dials and pointers either
the total quantity of electricity (in amp-hours) or the total amount of electrical energy (in watt-hours
or kWh) supplied to a circuit in a given time. This summation gives the product of time and the
electrical quantity but gives no direct indication as to the rate at which the quantity or energy is being
supplied because their registrations are independent of this rate provided the current flowing through
the instrument is sufficient to operate it.
Ampere-hour and watt-hour meters fall in this class.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 377
10.3. Essentials of Indicating Instruments
As defined above, indicating instruments are those which indicate the value of the quantity that is
being measured at the time at which it is measured. Such instruments consist essentially of a pointer
which moves over a calibrated scale and which is attached to a moving system pivoted in jewelled
bearings. The moving system is subjected to the following three torques :
1. A deflecting (or operating) torque
2. A controlling (or restoring) torque
3. A damping torque.
10.4. Deflecting Torque
The deflecting or operating torque (T ) is produced by utilizing one or other effects mentioned in
d
Art. 10.2 i.e. magnetic, electrostatic, electrodynamic, thermal or inductive etc. The actual method of
torque production depends on the type of instrument and will be discussed in the succeeding para-
graphs. This deflecting torque causes the moving system (and hence the pointer attached to it) to
move from its ‘zero’ position i.e. its position when the instrument is disconnected from the supply.
10.5. Controlling Torque
The deflection of the moving system would be indefinite if there were no controlling or restoring
torque. This torque oppose the deflecting torque and increases with the deflection of the moving
system. The pointer is brought to rest at a position where the two opposing torques are equal. The
deflecting torque ensures that currents of different magnitudes shall produce deflections of the mov-
ing system in proportion to their size. Without such at torque, the pointer would swing over to the
maximum deflected position irrespective of the magnitude of the current to be measured. Moreover,
in the absence of a restoring torque, the pointer once deflected, would not return to its zero position
on removing the current. The controlling or restoring or balancing torque in indicating instruments is
obtained either by a spring or by gravity as described below :
(a) Spring Control
A hair-spring, usually of phosphor-
bronze, is attached to the moving
system of the instrument as shown in
Fig. 10.1 (a).
With the deflection of the pointer,
the spring is twisted in the opposite
direction. This twist in the spring
produces restoring torque which is
directly proportional to the angle of
deflection of the moving system. The
pointer comes to a position of rest (or
equilibrium) when the deflecting torque
(T ) and controlling torque (T) are equal.
d c
For example, in permanent-magnet,
moving-coil type of instruments, the
deflecting torque is proportional to the
current passing through them.
Fig. 10.1
∴ T ∝ I
d
and for spring control T ∝ θ
c
As T = T
c d
∴ θ ∝ I378 Electrical Technology
Since deflection θ is directly proportional to current I, the spring-controlled instruments have a
uniform or equally-spaced scales over the whole of their range as shown in Fig. 10.1 (b).
To ensure that controlling torque is proportional to the angle of deflection, the spring should
have a fairly large number of turns so that angular deformation per unit length, on full-scale deflec-
tion, is small. Moreover, the stress in the spring should be restricted to such a value that it does not
produce a permanent set in it.
Springs are made of such materials which
(i) are non-magnetic
(ii) are not subject to much fatigue
(iii) have low specific resistance-especially in cases where they are used for leading current in or
out of the instrument
(iv) have low temperature-resistance coefficient.
The exact expression for controlling torque is T = Cθ where C is spring constant. Its value is
c
given by C =
Ebt3
N-m/rad. The angle θ is in radians.
L
(b) Gravity Control
Gravity control is obtained by attaching a small adjustable weight to some part of the moving
system such that the two exert torques in the opposite directions. The usual arrangements is shown in
Fig. 10. 2(a).
It is seen from Fig. 10.2 (b) that the con-
trolling or restoring torque is proportional
to the sine of the angle of deflection i.e.
T ∝ sin θ
c
The degree of control is adjusted by
screwing the weight up or down the carry-
ing system
It T ∝ I
d
then for position of rest
T = T
d c
Fig. 10.2
or I ∝ sin θ (not θ)
It will be seen from Fig. 10.2 (b) that as θ approaches 90º, the distance AB increases by a
relatively small amount for a given change in the angle than when
θ is just increasing from its zero value. Hence, gravity-controlled
instruments have scales which are not uniform but are cramped
or crowded at their lower ends as shown in Fig. 10.3.
As compared to spring control, the disadvantages of gravity
control are :
1. it gives cramped scale
2. the instrument has to be kept vertical. Fig. 10.3
However, gravity control has the following advantages :
1. it is cheap
2. it is unaffected by temperature
3. it is not subjected to fatigue or deterioration with time.
Example 10.1 The torque of an ammeter varies as the square of the current through it. If a
current of 5 A produces a deflection of 90º, what deflection will occur for a current of 3 A when the
instrument is (i) spring-controlled and (ii) gravity-controlled.
(Elect. Meas. Inst and Meas. Jadavpur Univ.)Electrical Instruments and Measurements 379
Solution. Since deflecting torque varies as (current)2, we have T ∝ I2
d
For spring control, T ∝ θ ∴θ ∝ I2
c
For gravity control,T ∝ sin θ ∴sin θ ∝ I2
c
(i) For spring control 90º ∝ 52 and θ ∝ 32; θ = 90° × 32/52 = 32.4º
(ii) For gravity control sin 90º ∝ 52 and sin θ ∝ 32
sin θ = 9/25 = 0.36 ; θ = sin −1 (0.36) = 21.1º.
10.6. Damping Torque
A damping force is one which acts on the moving
system of the instrument only when it is moving and
always opposes its motion. Such stabilizing or demping
force is necessary to bring the pointer to rest quickly,
otherwise due to inertia of the moving system, the pointer
will oscillate about its final deflected position for quite
some time before coming to rest in the steady position.
The degree of damping should be adjusted to a value
which is sufficient to enable the pointer to rise quickly
to its deflected position without overshooting. In that
case, the instrument is said to be dead-beat. Any
increase of damping above this limit i.e. overdamping Fig. 10.4
will make the instruments slow and lethargic. In Fig. 10.4 is shown the effect of damping on the
variation of position with time of the moving system of an instrument.
The damping force can be produced by (i) air frictions (ii) eddy currents and (iii) fluid friction
(used occasionally).
Two methods of air-friction damping are shown in Fig. 10.5 (a) and 10.5 (b). In Fig.. 10.5 (a),
the light aluminium piston attached to the moving system of the instrument is arranged to travel with

a very small clearance in a fixed air chamber closed at one end. The cross-section of the chamber is
either circular or rectangular. Damping of the oscillation is affected by the compression and suction
actions of the piston on the air enclosed in the chamber. Such a system of damping is not much
favoured these days, those shown in Fig. 10.5 (b) and (c) being preferred. In the latter method, one
or two light aluminium vanes are mounted on the spindle of the moving system which move in a
closed sector-shaped box as shown.
Fluid-friction is similar in action to the air friction. Due to greater viscosity of oil, the damping
is more effective. However, oil damping is not much used because of several disadvantages such as
objectionable creeping of oil, the necessity of using the instrument always in the vertical position and
its obvious unsuitability for use in portable instruments.380 Electrical Technology
The eddy-current form of damping is the most efficient of the three. The two forms of such a
damping are shown in Fig. 10.6 and 10.7. In Fig. 10.6 (a) is shown a thin disc of a conducting but
non-magnetic material like copper or aluminium mounted on the spindle which carries the moving
system and the pointer of the instrument. The disc is so positioned that its edges, when in rotation, cut
the magnetic flux between the poles of a permanent magnet. Hence, eddy currents are produced in
the disc which flow and so produce a damping force in such a direction as to oppose the very cause
producing them (Lenz’s Law Art. 7.5). Since the cause producing them is the rotation of the disc,
these eddy current retard the motion of the disc and the moving system as a whole.
Fig. 10.6
In Fig. 10.7 is shown the second type of
eddy-current damping generally employed
in permanent-magnet moving coil instru-
ments. The coil is wound on a thin light
aluminium former in which eddy currents
are produced when the coil moves in the
field of the permanent magnet. The direc-
tions of the induced currents and of the
damping force produced by them are shown
in the figure.

order in which they would be discussed in

11. Clock meters (as Wh-meters).
10.7. Moving-iron Ammeters and Voltmeters
There are two basic forms of these
instruments i.e. the attraction type and
the repulsion type. The operation of
the attraction type depends on the at-
traction of a single piece of soft iron
into a magnetic field and that of repul-
sion type depends on the repulsion of
two adjacent pieces of iron magnetised
by the same magnetic field. For both
types of these instruments, the neces-
sary magnetic field is produced by the
Moving iron voltmeter Moving iron ammeter
ampere-turns of a current-carrying coil.
In case the instrument is to be used as
an ammeter, the coil has comparatively fewer turns of thick wire so that the ammeter has low resis-
tance because it is connected in series with the circuit. In case it is to be used as a voltmeter, the coil
has high impedance so as to draw as small a
current as possible since it is connected in par-
allel with the circuit. As the current through
the coil is small, it has large number of turns
in order to produce sufficient ampere-turns.
10.8. Attraction Type M.I.
Insturments
The basic working principle of an attrac-
tion-type moving-iron instrument is illustrated
in Fig. 10.8. It is well-known that if a piece of
an unmagnetised soft iron is brought up near
either of the two ends of a current-carrying coil,
it would be attracted into the coil in the same
way as it would be attracted by the pole of a
bar magnet. Hence, if we pivot an oval-shaped
disc of soft iron on a spindle between bear-
ings near the coil (Fig. 10.8), the iron disc will
swing into the coil when the latter has an elec-
tric current passing through it. As the field
Fig. 10.8
strength would be strongest at the centre of382 Electrical Technology
the coil, the ovalshaped iron disc is pivoted in such a way that the greatest bulk of iron moves into the
centre of the coil. If a pointer is fixed to the spindle carrying the disc, then the passage of current
through the coil will cause the pointer to deflect. The amount of deflection produced would be
greater when the current producing the magnetic field is greater. Another point worth noting is that
whatever the direction of current through the coil, the iron disc would always be magnetised in
such a way that it is pulled inwards. Hence, such instruments can be used both for direct as well as
alternating currents.
A sectional view of the actual instrument is shown in Fig. 10.9. When the current to be measured
is passed through the coil or solenoid, a magnetic field is produced, which attracts the eccentrically-
mounted disc inwards, thereby deflecting the pointer, which moves over a calibrated scale.
Deflecting Torque
Let the axis of the iron disc, when in zero position, subtend an angle of φ with a direction perpen-
dicular to the direction of the field H produced by the coil. Let the deflection produced be θ corre-
sponding to a current I through the coil. The magnetisation of iron disc is proportional to the compo-
nent of H acting along the axis of the disc i.e. proportional to H cos [90 − (φ + θ)] or H sin (θ + φ).
The force F pulling the disc inwards is proportional to MH or H2 sin (θ + φ). If the permeability of
iron is assumed constant, then, H ∝ I. Hence, F ∝ I2 sin (θ + φ). If this force acted at a distance of l
from the pivot of the rotating disc, then deflecting torque T = Fl cos (θ + φ). Putting the value of F,
d
we get
T ∝ I2 sin (θ + φ) × l cos (θ + φ) ∝ I2 sin 2 (θ + φ) = KI2 sin 2 (θ + φ) ...sin l is constant
d
If spring-control is used, then controlling torque T = K′ θ
c
In the steady position of deflection, T = T
d c
∴ KI2 sin 2 (θ + φ) = K′ θ ; Hence θ ∝ I2

If A.C. is used, then θ ∝ I2

However, if gravity-control is used, then T = K sin θ
c 1
∴ KI2 sin 2 (θ + φ) = K sin θ ∴ sin θ αI2 sin 2 (θ + φ)

In both cases, the scales would be uneven.
Damping
As shown, air-friction damping is provided, the actual arrangement being a light piston moving
in an air-chamber.
10.9. Repulsion Type M.I. Instruments
The sectional view and cut-away view of such an instrument are shown in Fig. 10.11 and 10.12.
It consists of a fixed coil inside which are placed two soft-iron rods (or bars) A and B parallel to one
another and along the axis of the coil. One of them i.e. A is fixed and the other B which is movable
carries a pointer that moves over a calibrated scale. When the current to be measured is passedElectrical Instruments and Measurements 383
Fig. 10.11 Fig. 10.12
through the fixed coil, it sets up its own magnetic field which magnetises the two rods similarly i.e.
the adjacent points on the lengths of the rods will have the same magnetic polarity. Hence, they repel
each other with the result that the pointer is deflected against the controlling torque of a spring or
gravity. The force of repulsion is approximately proportional to the square of the current passing
through the coil. Moreover, whatever may be the direction of the current through the coil, the two
rods will be magnetised similaraly and hence will repel each other.
In order to achieve uniformity of scale, two tongue-shaped strips of iron are used instead of two
rods. As shown in Fig. 10.13 (a), the fixed iron consists of a tongue-shaped sheet iron bent into a
cylindrical form, the moving iron also consists of another sheet of iron and is so mounted as to move
parallel to the fixed iron and towards its narrower end [Fig. 10.13 (b)].
Deflecting Torque
The deflecting torque is due to the repulsive force between the two similarly magnetised iron
rods or sheets.
Fig. 10.13
Instantaneous torque ∝ repulsive force ∝ m m ...product of pole strengths
1 2
Since pole strength are proportional to the magnetising force H of the coil,
∴ instantaneous torque ∝ H2
Since H itself is proportional to current (assuming constant permeability) passing through the
coil, ∴ instantaneous torque ∝ I2
Hence, the deflecting torque, which is proportional to the mean torque is, in effect, proportional
to the mean value of I2. Therefore, when used on a.c. circuits, the instrument reads the r.m.s. value of
current.
Scales of such instruments are uneven if rods are used and uniform if suitable-shaped pieces of
iron sheet are used.
The instrument is either gravity-controlled or as in modern makes, is spring-controlled.
Damping is pneumatic, eddy current damping cannot be employed because the presence of a
permanent magnet required for such a purpose would affect the deflection and hence, the reading of
the instrument.
Since the polarity of both iron rods reverses simultaneously, the instrument can be used both for
a.c. and d.c. circuits i.e. instrument belongs to the unpolarised class.384 Electrical Technology
10.10. Sources of Error
There are two types of possible errors in such instruments, firstly, those which occur both in a.c.
and d.c. work and secondly, those which occur in a.c. work alone.
(a) Errors with both d.c. and a.c. work
(i) Error due to hysteresis. Because of hysteresis in the iron parts of the moving system, read-
ings are higher for descending values but lower for ascending values.
The hysteresis error is almost completely eliminated by using Mumetal or Perm-alloy, which
have negligible hysteresis loss.
(ii) Error due to stray fields. Unless shielded effectively from the effects of stray external
fields, it will give wrong readings. Magnetic shielding of the working parts is obtained by using a
covering case of cast-rion.
(b) Errors with a.c. work only
Changes of frequency produce (i) change in the impedance of the coil and (ii) change in the
magnitude of the eddy currents. The increase in impedance of the coil with increase in the frequency
of the alternating current is of importance in voltmeters (Ex. 10.2). For frequencies higher than the
one used for calibration, the instrument gives lower values. However, this error can be removed by
connecting a capacitor of suitable value in parallel with the swamp resistance R of the instrument. It
can be shown that the impedance of the whole circuit of the instrument becomes independent of
frequency if C = L/R2 where C is the capacitance of the capacitor.
10.11. Advantages and Disadvantages
Such instruments are cheap and robust, give a reliable service and can be used both on a.c. and
d.c. circuits, although they cannot be calibrated with a high degree of precision with d.c. on account
of the effect of hysteresis in the iron rods or vanes. Hence, they are usually calibrated by comparison
with an alternating current standard.
10.12. Deflecting Torque in terms of Change in Self-induction
The value of the deflecting torque of a moving-iron instrument can be found in terms of the
variation of the self-inductance of its coil with deflection θ.
Suppose that when a direct current of I passes through the instrument, its deflection is θ and
inductance L. Further suppose that when current changes from I to (I + dI), deflection changes from
θ to (θ + dθ) and L changes to (L + dL). Then, the increase in the energy stored in the magnetic field

is dE = d ( LI2) = L2I.dI + I2dL = LI. dI + I2. dL joule.

If T N-m is the controlling torque for deflection θ, then extra energy stored in the control

system is T × dθ joules. Hence, the total increase in the stored energy of the system is

10.13. Extension of Range by Shunts and Multipliers
(i) As Ammeter. The range of the moving-iron instrument, when used as an ammeter, can be
extended by using a suitable shunt across its terminals. So far as the operation with direct current is
concerned, there is no trouble, but with alternating current, the division of current between the instrument
and shunt changes with the change in the applied frequency. For a.c. work, both the inductance and
resistance of the instrument and shunt have to be taken into account.

Obviously, = s s = s
current through shunt,I R+ jωL Z

where R, L = resistance and inductance of the instrument
R, L = resistance and inductance of the shunt

It can be shown that above ratio i.e. the division of current between the instrument and shunt
would be independent of frequency if the time-constants of the instrument coil and shunt are the same
i.e. if L/R = L/R. The multiplying power (N) of the shunt is given by
s s
N = I =1+ R

where I = line current ; i = full-scale deflection current of the instrument.
(ii) As Voltmeter. The range of this instrument, when used as a voltmeter, can be extended or
multiplied by using a high non-inductive resistance R connected in series with it, as shown in Fig.
10.14. This series resistance is known as ‘multiplier’ when used on d.c. circuits. Suppose, the range
of the instrument is to be extended from ν to V. Then obviously, the excess voltage of (V − ν) is to be
dropped across R. If i is the full-scale deflection current of the instrument, then
Fig. 10.14 Fig. 10.15
iR = V − ν; R = V −ν = V −ir =V −r
i i i
Voltage magnification = V/ν. Since iR = V − ν; ∴ iR =V −1
ν ν
( )
or i i R r =V ν −1 ∴ V ν = 1+R r
Hence, greater the value of R, greater is the extension in the voltage range of the instrument.
For d.c. work, the principal requirement of R is that its value should remain constant i.e. it should
have low temperature-coefficient. But for a.c. work it is essential that total impedance of the voltme-
ter and the series resistance R should remain as nearly constant as possible at different
frequencies. That is why R is made as non-inductive as possible in order to keep the inductance of the
whole circuit to the minimum. The frequency error introduced by the inductance of the instrument coil
can be compensated by shunting R by a capacitor C as shown in Fig. 10.15. In case r ^ R, the impedance
of the voltmeter circuit will remain practically constant (for frequencies upto 1000 Hz) provided.386 Electrical Technology

Solution. When used on d.c. supply, the instrument offers ohmic resistance only. Hence, resis-
tance of the instrument = 250/0.05 = 5000 Ω.
When used on a.c. supply, the instrument offers impedance instead of ohmic resistance.
impedance at 100 Hz = 50002 +(2π×100×1)2 = 5039.3 Ω
∴ voltage of the instrument = 250 × 5000/5039.3 = 248 V
Example 10.3. A spring-controlled moving-iron voltmeter reads correctly on 250-V d.c. Calcu-
late the scale reading when 250-V a.c. is applied at 50 Hz. The instrument coil has a resistance of
500 Ω and an inductance of 1 H and the series (non-reactive) resistance is 2000 Ω.
(Elect. Instru. & Measure. Nagpur Univ. 1992)
Solution. Total circuit resistance of the voltmeter is
= (r + R) = 500 + 2,000 = 2,500 Ω
Since the voltmeter reads correctly on direct current supply, its full-scale deflection current is
= 250/2500 = 0.1 A.
When used on a.c. supply, instrument offers an impedance
Z = 25002 +(2π×50×1)2 = 2.520 Ω ∴ I = 0.099 A
∴ Voltmeter reading on a.c. supply = 250 × 0.099/0.1 = 248 V*
Note. Since swamp resistance R = 2,000 Ω, capacitor required for compensating the frequency error is
C = 0.41 L/R2 = 0.41 × 1/20002 = 0.1 μF.
Example 10.4. A 150-V moving-iron voltmeter intended for 50 Hz has an inductance of 0.7 H
and a resistance of 3 kΩ. Find the series resistance required to extend the range of the instrument to
300 V. If this 300-V, 50-Hz instrument is used to measure a d.c. voltage, find the d.c. voltage when
the scale reading is 200 V. (Elect. Measur, A.M.I.E. Sec B, 1991)
Solution. Voltmeter reactance = 2π × 50 × 0.7 = 220 Ω
Impedance of voltmeter = (3000 + j 220) = 3008 Ω
When the voltmeter range is doubled, its impedance has also to be doubled in order to have the
same current for full-scale deflection. If R is the required series resistance, then (3000 + R)2 + 2202
= (2 × 3008)2 ∴ R = 3012 Ω
When used on d.c. supply, if the voltmeter reads 200 V, the actual applied d.c. voltage would be
= 200 × (Total A.C. Impedance)/total d.c. resistance) = 200 × (2 × 3008)/(3000 + 3012) = 200 ×
(6016 × 6012) = 200.134 V.
Example 10.5. The coil of a moving-iron voltmeter has a resistance of 5,000 Ω at 15ºC at which
temperature it reads correctly when connected to a supply of 200 V. If the coil is wound with wire
whose temperature coefficient at 15ºC is 0.004, find the percentage error in the reading when the
temperature is 50ºC.
In the above instrument, the coil is replaced by one of 2,000 Ω but having the same number of
turns and the full 5,000 Ω resistance is obtained by connecting in series a 3,000 Ω resistor of negli-
gible temperature-coefficient. If this instrument reads correctly at 15ºC, what will be its percentage
error at 50ºC.
Solution. Current at 15ºC = 200/5,000 = 0.04 A
Resistance at 50ºC is R = R (1+ α × 35)
50 15 15
∴ R = 5,000 (1 + 35 × 0.004) = 5,700 Ω
50
* or reading = 250 × 2500/2520 = 248 V.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 387
∴ current at 50ºC = 200/5,700
200×(200/5,700)
∴ reading at 50ºC = = 175.4 V or = 200 × 5000/5700 = 175.4 V
0.04
175.4−200
∴ % error = ×100 = −−−−−12.3%
200
In the second case, swamp resistance is 3,000 Ω whereas the resistance of the instrument is only
2,000 Ω.
Instrument resistance at 50ºC = 2,000 (1 + 35 × 0.004) = 2,280 Ω
∴ total resistance at 50ºC = 3,000 + 2,280 = 5,280 Ω
∴ current at 50ºC = 200/5,280 A
200/5,280
∴ instrument reading = 200 × = 189.3 V
0.04
189.3−200
∴ percentage error = ×100 = −−−−−5.4 %

Example 10.6. The change of inductance for a moving-iron ammeter is 2μH/degree. The
control spring constant is 5 × 10 −7 N-m/degree.
The maximum deflection of the pointer is 100º, what is the current corresponding to maximum
deflection ? (Measurement & Instrumentation Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. As seen from Art. 10.12 the deflecting torque is given by
T =
1 I2 dL
N-m
d 2 dθ
Control spring constant = 5 × 10 −7 N-m/degree
Deflection torque for 100° deflection = 5 × 10 −7 × 100 = 5 × 10 −5 N-m ; dL/dθ = 2 μH/degree =
2 × 10 −6 H/degree.
∴ 5 × 10 −5 = 1I2 × 2 × 10 −6 ∴ I2 = 50 and I = 7.07 A

Example 10.7. The inductance of attraction type instrument is given by L = (10 + 5θ − θ2)μH
where θ is the deflection in radian from zero position. The spring constant is 12 × 10 −6 N-m/rad.
Find out the deflection for a current of 5 A.
(Elect. and Electronics Measurements and Measuring Instruments Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. L = (10 + 5 θ − θ2) × 10 −6 H
∴ dL = (0 + 5 − 2 × θ) × 10–6 = (5 − 2θ) × 10 −6 H/rad

Let the deflection be θ radians for a current of 5A, then deflecting torque,
T = 12 × 10 −6 × θ N-m

Also, T = 1 I2 dL ...Art.

Equating the two torques, we get

correctly on both d.c. circuits or frequency 60 ? [0.44 μF in parallel with series resistance]388 Electrical Technology
3. A 10-V moving-iron ammeter has a full-scale deflection of 40 mA on d.c. circuit. It reads 0.8% low

10.14. Moving-coil Instruments
There are two types of such instruments (i) permanent-magnet type which can be used for d.c.
work only and (ii) the dynamometer type which can be used both for a.c. and d.c. work.
10.15. Permanent Magnet Type Instruments
The operation of a permanent-magnet moving-coil type instrument is be based upon the prin-
ciple that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it is acted upon by a force
which tends to move it to one side and out of the field.
Construction
As its name indicates, the instrument consists of a permanent magnet and a rectangular coil of
many turns wound on a light aluminium or copper former inside which is an iron core as shown in
Fig. 10.16. Fig. 10.17
Fig. 10.16. The powerfull U-shaped permanent magnet is made of Alnico and has soft-iron end-pole
pieces which are bored out cylindrically. Between the magnetic poles is fixed a soft iron cylinder
whose function is (i) to make the field radial and uniform and (ii) to decrease the reluctance of the air
path between the poles and hence increase the magnetic flux. Surrounding the core is a rectangular
coil of many turns wound on a light aluminium frame which is supported by delicate bearings and to
which is attached a light pointer. The aluminium frame not only provides support for the coil but also
provides damping by eddy currents induced in it. The sides of the coil are free to move in the two air-
gaps between the poles and core as shown in Fig. 10.16 and Fig. 10.17. Control of the coil movement
is affected by two phosphor-bronze hair springs, one above and one below, which additionally serve
the purpose of lending the current in and out of the coil. The two springs are spiralled in opposite
directions in order to neutralize the effects of temperature changes.
Deflecting Torque
When current is passed through the coil, force acts upon
its both sides which produce a deflecting torque as shown in
Fig. 10.18. Let
B = flux density in Wb/m2
l = length or depth of the coil in metre
b = breadth of coil in metre Fig. 10.18Electrical Instruments and Measurements 389
N = number of turns in the coil
If I ampere is the current passing through the coil, then the magnitude of the force experienced by
each of its sides is = BIl newton
For N turns, the force on each side of the coil is = NBIl newton
∴ deflecting torque T = force × perpendicular distance
d
= NBIl × b = NBI(I × b) = NBIA N-m
where A is the face area of the coil.
It is seen that if B is constant, then T is proportional to the current passing through the coil i.e.
d
T ∝ I.
d
Such instruments are invariable spring-controlled so that T ∝ deflection θ.
c
Since at the final deflected position, T = T ∴ θ ∝ I
d c
Hence, such instruments have uniform scales. Damping is electromagnetic i.e. by eddy currents
induced in the metal frame over which the coil is wound. Since the frame moves in an intense
magnetic field, the induced eddy currents are large and damping is very effective.
10.16. Advantage and Disadvantages
The permanent-magnet moving-coil (PMMC) type instruments have the following advantages
and disadvantages :
Advantages
1. they have low power consumption.
2. their scales are uniform and can be designed to extend over an arc of 170° or so.
3. they possess high (torque/weight) ratio.
4. they can be modified with the help of shunts and resistances to cover a wide range of cur-
rents and voltages.
5. they have no hysteresis loss.
6. they have very effective and efficient eddy-current damping.
7. since the operating fields of such instruments are very strong, they are not much affected by
stray magnetic fields.
Disadvantages
1. due to delicate construction and the necessary accurate machining and assembly of various
parts, such instruments are somewhat costlier as compared to moving-iron instruments.
2. some errors are set in due to the aging of control springs and the parmanent magnets.
Such instruments are mainly used for d.c. work only, but they have been sometimes used in
conjunction with rectifiers or thermo-junctions for a.c. measurements over a wide range or frequencies.
Permanent-magnet moving-coil instruments can be used
as ammeters (with the help of a low resistance shunt) or as
voltmeters (with the help of a high series resistance).
The principle of permanent-magnet moving-coil type
instruments has been utilized in the construction of the fol-
lowing :
1. For a.c. galvanometer which can be used for detect-
ing extremely small d.c. currents. A galvanometer
may be used either as an ammeter (with the help of
a low resistance) or as a voltmeter (with the help of
a high series resistance). Such a galvanometer (of
pivoted type) is shown in Fig. 10.19.
2. By eliminating the control springs, the instrument
can be used for measuring the quantity of electric-
ity passing through the coil. This method is used
Fig. 10.19
for fluxmeters.390 Electrical Technology
3. If the control springs of such an instrument are purposely made of large
moment of inertia, then it can be used as ballistic galvanometer.
10.17. Extension of Range
(i) As Ammeter
When such an instrument is used as an ammeter, its range can be extended with the help of a low-
resistance shunt as shown in Fig. 10.12 (a). This shunt provides a bypath for extra current because it
is connected across (i.e. in parallel with) the instrument. These shunted instruments can be made to
record currents many times greater than their normal full-scale de-
flection currents. The ratio of maximum current (with shunt) to the
full-scale deflection current (without shunt) is known as the ‘multi-
plying power’ or ‘multiplying factor’ of the shunt.
Let R = instrument resistance
m
S = shunt resistance
I = full-scale deflection current of the instrument
m
Fig. 10.20 (a)
I = line current to be measured
As seen from Fig. 10.20 (a), the voltage across the instrument coil and the shunt is the same since
both are joined in parallel.
∴ I × R = S I = S (I − I ) ∴ S = I m R m ; Also I =⎜ ⎛ 1+ R m⎟ ⎞
m m s m (I −I ) I ⎝ S ⎠
m m
∴ multiplying power = ⎛ ⎜1+ R m ⎞ ⎟
⎝ S ⎠
Obviously, lower the value of shunt resistance, greater its multiplying power.
(ii) As voltmeter
The range of this instrument when used as a voltmeter can be increased by using a high resistance
in series with it [Fig. 10.20 (b)].
Let I = full-scale deflection current
m
R = galvanometer resistance
m
ν = R I = full-scale p.d. across it
m m
V = voltage to be measured
R = series resistance required
Then it is seen that the voltage drop across R is V − ν
∴ R = V −ν or R . I = V − ν
I m
m Fig. 10.20 (b)
Dividing both sides by ν, we get
R ν I m = V ν −1 or R I . R I m =V ν −1 ∴ V ν = ⎜ ⎛ ⎝ 1+ R R ⎟ ⎞ ⎠
m m m
∴ voltage multiplication = ⎛ ⎜1+ R ⎞ ⎟
⎝ R ⎠
m
Obviously, larger the value of R, greater the voltage multiplication or range. Fig. 10.20 (b)
shown a voltmeter with a single multiplier resistor for one range. A multi-range voltmeter requires on
multiplier resistor for each additional range.
Example 10.8. A moving coil ammeter has a fixed shunt of 0.02 Ω with a coil circuit rtesistance
of R = 1 kΩ and need potential difference of 0.5 V across it for full-scale deflection.
(1) To what total current does this correspond ?
(2) Calculate the value of shunt to give full scale deflection when the total current is 10 A and
75 A. (Measurement & Instrumentation Nagpur Univ. 1993)Electrical Instruments and Measurements 391
Solution. It should be noted that the shunt and the meter coil are in parallel and have a common
p.d. of 0.5 V applied across them.
(1) ∴I = 0.5/1000 = 0.0005 A; I = 0.5./0.02 = 25 A
m s
∴ line current = 25.0005 A
(2) When total current is 10 A, I = (10 − 0.0005) = 9.9995 A
s
I R 0.0005×1000
∴ S = m m = = 0.05 Ω
I 9.9995
s
When total current is 75 A, I = (75−0.0005) = 74.9995 A
s
∴ S = 0.0005 × 1000/74.9995 = 0.00667 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Example 10.9. A moving-coil instrument has a resistance of 10 Ω and gives full-scale deflec-
tion when carrying a current of 50 mA. Show how it can be adopted to measure voltage up to 750 V
and currents upto 1000 A. (Elements of Elect. Engg.I, Bangalore Univ.)
Solution. (a) As Ammeter.
As discussed above, current range
of the meter can be extended by us-
ing a shunt across it [Fig. 10.21
(a)].
Obviously,
10 × 0.05 = S × 99.95
∴ S = 0.005 ΩΩΩΩΩ
(b) As Voltmeter. In this Fig. 10.21
case, the range can be extended by
using a high resistance R in series with it.
[Fig. 10.21 (b)]. Obviously, R must drop a voltage of (750−0.5) = 749.5 V while carrying 0.05 A.
∴ 0.05 R = 749.5 or R = 14.990 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Example 10.10. How will you use a P.M.M.C. instrument which gives full scale deflection at
50 mV p.d. and 10 mA current as
(1) Ammeter 0 - 10 A range

Example 10.11. A current galvanometer has the following parameters :
B = 10 × 10 −3 Wb/m2 ; N = 200 turns, l = 16 mm;
d = 16 mm; k = 12 × 10 −9 Nm/radian.
Calculate the deflection of the galvanometer when a current of 1 μA flows through it.
(Elect. Measurement Nagpur Univ. 1993)392 Electrical Technology
Solution. Deflecting torque T = NBIA N−m = 200 × (10 × 10 −3) × (1 × 10 −6) × (1 × 10 −3) × (16
d
× 10 −3) N-m = 512 × 10 −12 N−m
Controlling torque T = controlling spring constant × deflection = 12 × 10 −9 × θ N−m
c
Equating the deflecting and controlling torques, we have 12 × 110 −9 × θ = 512 × 10 −12
∴ θ = 0.0427 radian = 2.45º
Example 10.12. The coil of a moving coil permanent magnet voltmeter is 40 mm long and
30 mm wide and has 100 turns on it. The control spring exerts a torque of 120 × 10 −6 N-m when the
deflection is 100 divisions on full scale. If the flux density of the magnetic field in the air gap is
0.5 Wb/m2, estimate the resistance that must be put in series with the coil to give one volt per division.
The resistance of the voltmeter coil may be neglected. (Elect. Mesur. AMIE Sec. B Summer 1991)
Solution. Let I be the current for full-scale deflection. Deflection torque T = NBIA
= 100 × 0.5 × I × (1200 × 10 −6) = 0.06 I N-m d
Controlling torque T = 120 × 10 −6 N-m
c
In the equilibrium position, the two torques are equal i.e. T = T .
∴ 0.06 I = 120 × 10 −6 ∴ I = 2 × 10 −3 A. d c
Since the instrument is meant to read 1 volt per division, its full-scale reading is 100 V.
Total resistance = 100/2 × 10 −3= 50,000 Ω
Since voltmeter coil resistance is negligible, it represents the additional required resistance.
Example 10.13. Show that the torque produced in a permanent-magnet moving-coil instrument
is proportional to the area of the moving coil.
A moving-coil voltmeter gives full-scale deflection with a current of 5 mA. The coil has 100
turns, effective depth of 3 cm and width of 2.5 cm. The controlling torque of the spring is 0.5 cm for
full-scale deflection. Estimate the flux density in the gap. (Elect. Meas, Marathwads Univ.)
Solution. The full-scale deflecting torque is T = NBIA N-m
d
where I is the full-scale deflection current ; I = 5 mA = 0.005 A
T = 100 × B × 0.005 × (3 × 2.5 × 10 −4) = 3.75 × 10 −4 B N-m
d
The controlling torque is
T = 0.5 g-cm = 0.5 g. wt.cm = 0.5 × 10 −3 × 10 −2 kg wt-m
c = 0.5 × 10 −5 × 9.8 = 4.9 × 10 −5 N-m
For equilibrium, the two torques are equal and opposite.
∴ 4.9 × 10 −5 = 3.75 × 10 −4 B ∴ B = 0.13 Wb/m2
Example 10.14. A moving-coil milliammeter has a resistance of 5 Ω and a full-scale deflection
of 20 mA. Determine the resistance of a shunt to be used so that the instrument could measure
currents upto 500 mA at 20° C. What is the percentage error in the instrument operating at a
temperature of 40°C ? Temperature co-efficient of copper = 0.0039 per °C.
(Measu. & Instrumentation, Allahabad Univ. 1991)
Solution. Let R be the shunt resistance at 20°C. When the temperature is 20°C, line current is
20
500 mA and shunt current is = (500−20) = 480 mA.
∴ 5 × 20 = R × 480, R = 1/4.8 Ω
20 20
If R is the shunt resistance at 40ºC, then

Shunt current at 40ºC is = = 445 mA
1.078/4.8
Line current = 445 + 20 = 465 mA
Although, line current would be only 465 mA, the instrument will indicate 500 mA.
∴ error = 35/500 = 0.07 or 7%Electrical Instruments and Measurements 393
Example 10.15. A moving-coil millivoltmeter has a resistance of 20Ω and full-scale deflection
of 120º is reached when a potential difference of 100 mV is applied across its terminals. The moving
coil has the effective dimensions of 3.1 cm × 2.6 cm and is wound with 120 turns. The flux density in
the gap is 0.15 Wb/m2. Determine the control constant of the spring and suitable diameter of copper
wire for coil winding if 55% of total instrument resistance is due to coil winding. ρ for copper = 1.73
× 10 −6 Ω cm. (Elect. Inst. and Meas. M.S. Univ. Baroda)
Solution. Full-scale deflection current is = 100/20 = 5 mA
Deflecting torque for full-scale deflection of 120º is
T = NBIA = 120 × 0.15 × (5 × 10 −3) × (3.1 × 2.6 × 10 −4) = 72.5 × 10 −6 N-m
d
Control constant is defined as the deflecting torque per radian (or degree) or deflection of mov-
ing coil. Since this deflecting torque is for 120° deflection.
Control constant = 72.5 × 10 −6/120 = 6.04 ××××× 10−−−−−7 N-m/degree
Now, resistance of copper wire = 55% of 20 Ω = 11 Ω
Total length of copper wire = 120 × 2 (3.1 + 2.6) = 1368 cm
Now R = ρl/A ∴ A = 1.73 × 10 −6 × 1368/11 = 215.2 × 10 −6 cm2
∴ π d2/4 = 215.2 × 10 −6
∴ d = 215×4×10 −6/π = 16.55 × 10 −3 cm = 0.1655 mm
10.18.Voltmeter Sensitivity
It is defined in terms of resistance per volt (Ω/V). Suppose a meter movement of 1 kΩ internal
resistance has s full-scale deflection current of 50 μ A. Obviously, full-scale voltage drop of the
meter movement is = 50 μ A × 1000 Ω = 50 mV. When used as a voltmeter, its sensitivity would be
1000/50 × 10 −3 = 20 kΩ/V. It should be clearly understood that a sensitivity of 20 kΩ/V means that
the total resistance of the circuit in which the above movement is used should be 20 kΩ for a full-scale
deflection of 1 V.
10.19.Multi-range Voltmeter
It is a voltmeter which measures a number of voltage ranges with the help of different series
resistances. The resistance required for each range can be easily calculated provided we remember
one basic fact that the sensitivity of a meter movement is always the same regardless of the range
selected. Moreover, the full-scale deflection current is the same in every range. For any range, the
total circuit resistance is found by multiplying the sensitivity by the full-scale voltage for that range.
For example, in the case of the above-mentioned 50μA, 1 kΩ meter movement, total resistance
required for 1 V full-scale deflection is 20 kΩ. It means that an additional series resistance of 19 kΩ
is required for the purpose as shown in Fig. 10.22 (a).
Fig. 10.22
For 10-V range, total circuit resistance must be (20 kΩ/V) (10 V) = 200 kΩ. Since total resis-
tance for 1 V range is 20 kΩ, the series resistance R for 10-V range = 200 − 20 = 180 kΩ as shown in
Fig. 10.22 (b).
For the range of 100 V, total resistance required is (20 kΩ/V) (100 V) = 2 MΩ. The additional
resistance required can be found by subtracting the existing two-range resistance from the total394 Electrical Technology
resistance of 2 MΩ. Its value is
= 2 M Ω − 180 kΩ − 19 kΩ − 1 kΩ = 1.8 MΩ
It is shown in Fig. 10.22 (c).

10.20.Electrodynamic or Dynamometer Type Instruments
An electrodynamic instrument is a moving-coil instrument in which the operating field is pro-
duced, not by a permanent magnet but by another fixed coil. This instrument can be used either as an
ammeter or a voltmeter but is generally used as a wattmeter.
As shown in Fig. 10.23, the fixed coil is usually arranged in two equal sections F and F placed
close together and parallel to each other. The two fixed coils are air-cored to avoid hysteresis effectsElectrical Instruments and Measurements 395
when used on a.c. circuits. This has the effect of making the magnetic field in which moves the
moving coil M, more uniform. The moving coil is spring-controlled and has a pointer attached to it as
shown.
Fig. 10.23 Fig. 10.24
Deflecting Torque*
The production of the deflecting torque can be understood from Fig. 10.24. Let the current
passing through the fixed coil be I and that through the moving coil be I . Since there is no iron, the
1 2
field strength and hence the flux density is proportional to I .
1
∴ B = KI where K is a constant
1
Let us assume for simplicity that the moving coil is rectangular (it can be circular also) and of
dimensions l × b. Then, force on each side of the coil having N turns is (NBI l) newton.
2
The turning moment or deflecting torque on the coil is given by
T = NBI lb = NKI I lb N-m
d 2 1 2
Now, putting NKlb = K , we have T = K I I where K is another constant.
1 d 1 1 2 1
Fig. 10.25 Fig. 10.26
It shows that the deflecting torque is proportional to the product of the currents flowing in the
fixed coils and the moving coil. Since the instrument tis spring-controlled, the restoring or control
torque is proportional to the angular deflection θ.
i.e. T ∝ = K θ ∴ K I I = K θ or θ ∝ I I
c 2 1 1 2 2 1 2
* As shown in Art. 10.12, the value of torque of a moving-coil instrument is
T =
1 I2dL/dθN −m
d 2
The equivalent inductance of the fixed and moving coils of the electrodynamic instrument is
L = L + L + 2M
1 2
where M is the mutual inductance between the two coils and L and L are their individual self-inductances.
1 2
Since L and L are fixed and only M varies,
1 2
∴ dL/dθ = 2dM/dθ ∴ T 1 I2×2.dM/dθ=I2.dM/dθ
d 2
If the currents in the fixed and moving coils are different, say I and I then
1 2
T = I .I . dM/dθ N-m
d 1 2396 Electrical Technology
When the instrument is used as an ammeter, the same current
passes through both the fixed and the moving coils as shown in
Fig. 10.25.
In that case I = I = I, hence θ ∝ I2 or I ∝ θ. The connections
1 2
of Fig. 10.24 are used when small currents are to be measured. In
the case of heavy currents, a shunt S is used to limit current through
the moving coil as shown in Fig. 10.26.
When used as a voltmeter, the fixed and moving coils are joined
in series along with a high resistance and connected as shown in
Fig. 10.27 Fig. 10.27. Here, again I = I = I, where I
=V
in d.c. circuits and
1 2 R
I = V/Z in a.c. circuits.
∴ θ ∝ V × V or θ ∝ V2 or V ∝ θ
Hence, it is found that whether the instrument is used as an ammeter or voltmeter, its scale is
uneven throughout the whole of its range and is particularly cramped or crowded near the zero.
Damping is pneumatic, since owing to weak operating field, eddy current damping is inadmis-
sible. Such instruments can be used for both a.c. and d.c. measurements. But it is more expensive and
inferior to a moving-coil instrument for d.c. measurements.
As mentioned earlier, the most important application of electrodynamic principle is the wattme-
ter and is discussed in detail in Art. 10.34.
Errors
Since the coils are air-cored, the operating field produced is small. For producing an appreciable
deflecting torque, a large number of turns is necessary for the moving coil. The magnitude of the
current is also limited because two control springs are used both for leading in and for leading out the
current. Both these factors lead to a heavy moving system resulting in frictional losses which are
somewhat larger than in other types and so frictional errors tend to be relatively higher. The current
in the field coils is limited for the fear of heating the coils which results in the increase of their
resistance. A good amount of screening is necessary to avoid the influence of stray fields.
Advantages and Disadvantages
1. Such instruments are free from hysteresis and eddy-current errors.
2. Since (torque/weight) ratio is small, such instruments have low sensitivity.
Example 10.17. The mutual inductance of a 25-A electrodynamic ammeter changes uniformly
at a rate of 0.0035 μH/degree. The torsion constant of the controlling spring is 10 − 6 N-m per degree.
Determine the angular deflection for full-scale.
(Elect. Measurements, Poona Univ.)
Solution. By torsion constant is meant the deflecting torque per degree of deflection. If full-
scale deflecting is θ degree, then deflecting torque on full-scale is 10 − 6 × θ N-m.
Now, T = I2dM/dθ Also, I = 25 A
d
dM/dθ = 0.0035 × 10 − 6 H/degree = 0.0035 × 10 − 6 × 180/π H/radian
10 − 6 × θ = 252 × 0.0035 × 10 − 6 × 180 /π ∴ θ = 125.4°
Example 10.18. The spring constant of a 10-A dynamometer wattmeter is 10.5 × 10 − 6 N-m per
radian. The variation of inductance with angular position of moving system is practically linear
over the operating range, the rate of change being 0.078 mH per radian. If the full-scale deflection
of the instrument is 83 degrees, calculate the current required in the voltage coil at full scale on d.c.
circuit. (Elect. Inst. and Means. Nagpur Univ. 1991)
Solution. As seen from foot-note of Art. 10.20, T = I I dM/dθ N-m
d 1 2Electrical Instruments and Measurements 397
Spring constant = 10.5 × 10 − 6 N/m/rad = 10.5 × 10 −6 × π/180 N-m/degree
T = spring constant × deflection = (10.5 × 10 −6 × π/180) × 83 = 15.2 × 10 −6 N-m
∴ d 15.2 × 10 −6 = 10 × I × 0.078 ; I = 19.5 μA.

10.21. Hot-wire Instruments
The working parts of the instrument are shown in Fig.
10.28. It is based on the heating effect of current. It consists
of platinum-iridium (It can withstand oxidation at high tem-
peratures) wire AB stretched between a fixed end B and the
tension-adjusting screw at A. When current is passed through
AB, it expands according to I2R formula. This sag in AB
produces a slack in phosphor-bronze wire CD attached to
the centre of AB. This slack in CD is taken up by the silk
fibre which after passing round the pulley is attached to a
spring S. As the silk thread is pulled by S, the pulley moves, Fig. 10.28
thereby deflecting the pointer. It would be noted that even a
small sag in AB is magnified (Art. 10.22) many times and is conveyed to the pointer. Expansion of AB
is magnified by CD which is further magnified by the silk thread.
It will be seen that the deflection of the pointer is proportional to the extension of AB which is
itself proportional to I2. Hence, deflection is ∝ I2. If spring control is used, then T ∝ θ.
c
Hence θ ∝ I2
So, these instruments have a ‘squre law’ type scale. They read the r.m.s. value of current and
their readings are independent of its form and frequency.
Damping
A thin light aluminium disc is attached to the pulley such that its edge moves between the poles
of a permanent magnet M. Eddy currents produced in this disc give the necessary damping.
These instruments are primarily meant for being used as ammeters but can be adopted as voltme-
ters by connecting a high resistance in series with them. These instruments are suited both for a.c. and
d.c. work.
Advantages of Hot-wire Instruments :
1. As their deflection depends on the r.m.s. value of the alternating current, they can be used on
direct current also.
2. Their readings are independent of waveform and frequency.
3. They are unaffected by stray fields.
Disadvantages
1. They are sluggish owing to the time taken by the wire to heat up.
2. They have a high power consumption as compared to moving-coil instruments. Current
consumption is 200 mA at full load.
3. Their zero position needs frequent adjustment. 4. They are fragile.
10.22. Magnification of the Expansion
As shown in Fig. 10.29 (a), let L be the length of the wire AB and dL its expansion after steady
temperature is reached. The sag S produced in the wire as seen from Fig. 10.29 (a) is given by
S2 = ⎛ ⎜ L+dL⎞ ⎟ 2 − ⎛ ⎜ L ⎞ ⎟ 2 = 2L.dL+(dL)2

As shown in Fig. 10.29 (b), in the case of double-sag instru-
ments, this sag is picked up by wire CD which is under the constant
pull of the spring. Let L be the length of wire CD and let it be
1
pulled at its center, so as to take up the slack produced by the sag S
of the wire AB.

10.23.Thermocouple Ammeter
The working principle of this ammeter is based on the Seebeck effect, which was discovered in
1821. A thermocouple, made of two dissimilar metals (usually bismuth and antimony) is used in the
construction of this ammeter. The hot junction of the thermocouple is welded to a heater wire AB,
both of which are kept in vacuum as shown in Fig. 10.31 (a). The cold junction of the thermocouple
is connected to a moving-coil ammeter.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 399
When the current to be measured is passed through the heater wire AB, heat is generated, which
raises the temperature of the thermocouple junction J. As the junction temperature rises, the generated
Fig. 10.31
thermoelectric EMF increases and derives a greater current through the moving-coil ammeter. The
amount of deflection on the MC ammeter scale depend on the heating effect, since the amount of heat
produced is directly proportional to the square of the current. The ammeter scale is non-linear so that,
it is cramped at the low end and open at the high end as shown in Fig. 10.31 (b). This type of “current-
squared: ammeter is suitable for reading both direct and alternating currents. It is particularly suitable
for measuring radio-frequency currents such as those which
occur in antenna system of broadcast transmitters. Once
calibrated properly, the calibration of this ammeter remains
accurate from dc upto very high frequency currents.
10.24.Megger
It is a portable instrument used for testing the insulation
resistance of a circuit and for measuring resistances of the order
of megaohms which are connected across the outside terminals
Megger
XY in Fig. 10.32 (b).
Fig. 10.32
1. Working Principle
The working principle of a ‘corss-coil’ type megger may be understood from Fig. 10.32 (a)
which shows two coils A and B mounted rigidly at right angles to each other on a common axis and
free to rotate in a magnetic field. When currents are passed through them, the two coils are acted
upon by torques which are in opposite directions. The torque of coil A is proportional to I cos θ and
1
that of B is proportional to I cos (90 − θ) or I sin θ. The two coils come to a position of equilibrium
2 2
where the two torques are equal and opposite i.e. where
I cos θ = I sin θ or tan θ = I /I
1 2 1 2400 Electrical Technology
In practice, however, by modifying the shape of pole faces and the angle between the two coils,
the ratio I /I is made proportional to θ instead of tan θ in order to achieve a linear scale.
1 2
Suppose the two coils are connected across a common source of voltage i.e. battery C, as shown
in Fig. 10.32 (b). Coil A, which is connected directly across V, is called the voltage (or control) coil.
Its current I = V/R . The coil B called current or deflecting coil, carries the current I = V/R, where
1 1 2
R is the external resistance to be measured. This resistance may vary from infinity (for good insula-
tion or open circuit) to zero (for poor insulation or a short-circuit). The two coils are free to rotate in
the field of a permanent magnet. The deflection θ of the instrument is proportional to I /I which is
1 2
equal to R/R . If R is fixed, then the scale can be calibrated to read R directly (in practice, a current-
1 1
limiting resistance is connected in the circuit of coil B but the presence of this resistance can be
allowed for in scaling). The value of V is immaterial so long as it remains constant and is large
enough to give suitable currents with the high resistance to be measured.
2. Construction
The essential parts of a megger are shown in Fig. 10.33. Instead of battery C of Fig. 10.32 (b),
there is a hand-driven d.c. generator. The crank turns the generator armature through a clutch mecha-
nism which is designed to slip at a pre-determined speed. In this way, the generator speed and voltage
are kept constant and at their correct values when testing.
The generator voltage is applied across the voltage coil A through a fixed resistance R and
1
across deflecting coil B through a current-limiting resistance R′ and the external resistance is con-
nected across testing terminal XY. The two coils, in fact, constitute a moving-coil voltmeter and an
ammeter combined into one instrument.
(i) Suppose the terminals XY are open-circuited. Now, when crank is operated, the generator
voltage so produced is applied across coil A and current I flows through it but no current flows
1
through coil B. The torque so produced rotates the moving element of the megger until the scale
points to ‘infinity’, thus indicating that the resistance of the external circuit is too large for the instru-
ment to measure.
(ii) When the testing terminals XY are closed through a low resistance or are short-circuited,
then a large current (limited only by R′ ) passes through the deflecting coil B. The deflecting torque
produced by coil B overcomes the small opposing torque of coil A and rotates the moving element
until the needle points to ‘zero’, thus shown that the external resistance is too small for the instrument
to measure.
Fig. 10.33
Although, a megger can measure all resistance lying between zero and infinity, essentially it is a
high-resistance measuring device. Usually, zero is the first mark and 10 kΩ is the second mark on its
scale, so one can appreciate that it is impossible to accurately measure small resistances with the help
of a megger.
The instrument described above is simple to operate, portable, very robust and independent of
the external supplies.
10.25. Induction type Voltmeters and Ammeters
Induction type instruments are used only for a.c. measurements and can be used either as ammeter,Electrical Instruments and Measurements 401
voltmeter or wattmeter. However, the induction principle finds its widest application as a watt-hour
or energy meter. In such instruments, the deflecting torque is produced due to the reaction between
the flux of an a.c. magnet and the eddy currents induced by this flux. Before discussing the two types
of most commonly-used induction instruments, we will first discuss the underlying principle of their
operation.
Principle
The operation of all induction instruments depends on the production of torque due to the reac-
tion between a flux Φ (whose magnitude depends on the current or voltage to be measured) and
eddy currents induced 1 in a metal disc or drum by another flux Φ (whose magnitude also depends on
2
the current or voltage to be measured). Since the magnitude of eddy currents also depend on the flux
producing them, the instantaneous value of torque is proportional to the square of current or voltage
under measurement and the value of mean torque is proportional to the mean square value of this
current or voltage.
Fig. 10.34
Consider a thin aluminium or Cu disc D free to rotate about an axis passing through its centre as
shown in Fig. 19.34. Two a.c. magnetic poles P and P produce alternating fluxes Φ and Φ respec-
1 2 1 2
tively which cut this disc. Consider any annular portion of the disc around P with center on the axis
1
of P . This portion will be linked by flux Φ and so an alternating e.m.f. e be induced in it. This
1 1 1
e.m.f. will circulate an eddy current i which, as shown in Fig. 10.34, will pass under P . Similarly,
1 2
Φ will induce an e.m.f. e which will further induce an eddy current i in an annular portion of the
2 2 2
disc around P . This eddy current i flows under pole P .
2 2 1
Let us take the downward directions of fluxes as positive and further assume that at the instant
under consideration, both Φ and Φ are increasing. By applying Lenz’s law, the directions of the
1 2
induced currents i and i can be found and are as indicated in Fig. 10.34.
1 2
The portion of the disc which is traversed by flux Φ and carries eddy current i experiences a
1 2
force F along the direction as indicated. As F = Bil, force F ∝ Φ i . Similarly, the portion of the
1 1 1 2
disc lying in flux Φ and carrying eddy current i experiences a force F ∝ Φ i .
2 1 2 2 1
∴ F ∝ Φ i = K Φ i and F ∝ Φ i = K Φi .
1 12 1 2 2 2 1 21
It is assumed that the constant K is the same in both cases due to the symmetrically positions of
P and P with respect to the disc.
1 2
If r is the effective radius at which these forces act, the net instantaneous torque T acting on the
disc begin equal to the difference of the two torques, is given by
T = r (K Φi − K Φi ) = K (Φi − Φ i ) ...(i)
12 21 1 12 21
Let the alternating flux Φ be given by Φ = Φ sin ωt. The flux Φ which is assumed to lag Φ
1 1 1m 2 1
by an angle α radian is given by Φ = Φ sin (ωt − α)

It is obvious that
(i) if α = 0 i.e. if two fluxes are in phase, then net torque is zero. If on the other hand, α = 90°,
the net torque is maximum for given values of Φ and Φ .
1m 2m
(ii) the net torque is in such a direction as to rotate the disc from the pole with leading flux
towards the pole with lagging flux.
(iii) since the expression for torque does not involve ‘t’, it is independent of time i.e. it has a
steady value at all time.
(iv) the torque T is inversely proportional to R-the resistance of the eddy current path. Hence,
for large torques, the disc material should have low resistivity. Usually, it is made of Cu or, more
often, of aluminium.
10.26.Induction Ammeters
It has been shown in Art.10.22 above that the net torque acting on the disc is
T = K ωΦ Φ sin α
2 1m 2m
Obviously, if both fluxes are produced by the same alternating current (of maximum value I ) to
m
be measured, then T = K ωI2 sinα
3 m
Hence, for a given frequency ω and angle α, the torque is proportional to the square of the
current. If the disc has spring
control, it will take up a steady
deflected position where controlling
torque becomes equal to the
deflecting torque. By attaching a
suitable pointer to the disc, the
apparatus can be used as an ammeter.
There are three different pos-
sible arrangements by which the op-
erational requirements of induction
ammeters can be met as discussed
below. Fig. 10.35
(i) Disc Instrument with Split-phase Winding
In this arrangement, the windings on the two laminated a.c. magnets P and P are connected in
1 2
series (Fig. 10.35). But, the winding of P is shunted by a resistance R with the result that the current
2
in this winding lags with respect to the total line current. In this way, the necessary phase angle α is
produced between two fluxes Φ and Φ produced by P and P respectively. This angle is of the
1 2 1 2
order of 60°. If the hysteresis effects etc. are neglected, then each flux would be proportional to the
current to be measured i.e. line current I

Eddy current damping is employed in this instrument. When the disc rotates, it cuts the flux in
the air-gap of the magnet and has eddy currents induced in it which provide efficient damping.
(ii) Cylindrical type with Split-phase Winding
The operating principle of this instrument is the same as that of the above instrument except that
instead of a rotating disc, it employs a hollow aluminium drum as shown in Fig. 10.36. The poles P
1
produce the alternating flux Φ which produces eddy
1
current i in those portions of the drum that lie under
1
poles P . Similarly, flux F due to poles P produces
2 2 2
eddy current i in those parts of the drum that lie under
2
poles P . The force F which is ∝ Φ i and F which is
1 1 1 2 2
∝ Φ i are tangential to the surface of the drum and the
2 1
resulting torque tends to rotate the drum about its own
axis. Again, the winding of P is shunted by
2
resistance R which helps to introduce the necessary
phase difference α between F and F .
1 2
The spiral control springs (not shown in the fig-
ure) prevent any continuous rotation of the drum and
ultimately bring it to rest at a position where the
deflecting torque becomes equal to the controlling
torque of the springs. The drum has a pointer attached
to it and is itself carried by a spindle whose two ends fit
Fig. 10.36
in jewelled bearings. There is a cylindrical laminated
core inside the hollow drum whole function is to strengthen the flux cutting the drurm. The poles are
laminated and magnetic circuits are completed by the yoke Y and the core.
Damping is by eddy currents induced in
a separate aluminium disc (not shown in the
figure) carried by the spindle when it moves
in the air-gap flux of a horse-shoe magnet (also
not shown in the figure).
(iii) Shaded-pole Induction Ammeter
In the shaded-pole disc type induction
ammeter (Fig. 10.37) only single flux-produc-
ing winding is used. The flux F produced by
this winding is split up into two fluxes Φ and
1
Φ which are made to have the necessary phase
2
difference of α by the device shown in Fig.
10.37. The portions of the upper and lower
poles near the disc D are divided by a slot into
two halves one of which carries a closed ‘shad-
ing’ winding or ring. This shading winding or
ring acts as a short-circuited secondary and
the main winding as a primary. The current A.C.
magnet
induced in the ring by transformer action re-
tards the phase of flux Φ with
respect to that of Φ by about 50° or 2 so. The Fig. 10.37
1
two fluxes Φ and Φ passing through the unshaded and shaded parts respectively, react with eddy
1 2
currents i and i respectively and so produce the net driving torque whose value is

T ∝ Φ Φ sin α

Assuming that both Φ and Φ are proportional to the current I, we have
1 2
T ∝ I2
d404 Electrical Technology
This torque is balanced by the controlling torque provided by the spiral springs.
The actual shaded-pole type induction instruments is shown in Fig. 10.38. It consists of a suit-
ably-shaped aluminium or copper disc mounted on a spindly which is supported by jewelled bear-
ings. The spindle carries a pointer and has a control spring attached to it. The edge or periphery of
the disc moves in the air-gap of a laminated a.c. electromagnet which is energised either by the
current to be measured (as ammeter) or by a current proportional to the voltage to be measured (as a
voltmeter). Damping is by eddy currents induced by a permanent magnet embracing another portion
of the same disc. As seen, the disc
serves both for damping as well as op-
erating purposes. The main flux is split
into two components fluxes by shad-
Spring
ing one-half of each pole. These two
fluxes have a phase difference of 40°
to 50° between them and they
induce two eddy currents in the disc.
A.C. Each eddy current has a component in
Supply phase with the other flux, so that two
torques are produced which are oppo-
sitely directed. The resultant torque
is equal to the difference

Hence, such instruments have uneven scales i.e. scales which are cramped at their lower ends. A
more even scale can, however, be obtained by using a cam-shaped disc as shown in Fig. 10.38.
10.27. Induction Voltmeter
Its construction is similar to that of an
induction ammeter except for the difference
that its winding is wound with a large num-
ber of turns of fine wire. Since it is con-
nected across the lines and carries very small
current (5 − 10mA), the number of turns of
its wire has to be large in order to produce
an adequate amount of m.m.f. Split phase
windings are obtained by connecting a high
resistance R in series with the winding of
one magnet and an inductive coil in series
Fig. 10.39
with the winding of the other magnet as
shown in Fig. 10.39.
10.28. Errors in Induction Instruments
There are two types of errors (i) frequency error and (ii) temperature error.
1. Since deflecting torque depends on frequency, hence unless the alternating current to be
measured has same frequency with which the instrument was calibrated, there will be largeElectrical Instruments and Measurements 405
error in its readings. Frequency errors can be compensated for by the use of a non-inductive
shunt in the case of ammeters. In voltmeters, such errors are not large and, to a great extent,
are self-compensating.
2. Serious errors may occur due to the variation of temperature because the resistances of eddy
current paths depends on the temperature. Such errors can, however, be compensated for by
hunting in the case of ammeters and by combination of shunt and swamping resistances in
the case of voltmeters.
10.29.Advantages and Disadvantages
1. A full-scale deflection of over 200° can be obtained with such instruments. Hence, they
have long open scales.
2. Damping is very efficient.
3. They are not much affected by external stray fields.
4. Their power consumption is fairly large and cost relatively high.
5. They can be used for a.c. measurements only.
6. Unless compensated for frequency and temperature variations, serious errors may be intro-
duced.
10.30. Electrostatic Voltmeters
Electrostatic instruments are almost always used as voltmeters and that too more as a laboratory
rather than as industrial instruments. The underlying principle of their operation is the force of
attraction between electric charges on neighboring plates between which a p.d. is maintained. This
force gives rise to a deflecting torque. Unless the p.d. is sufficiently large, the force is small. Hence,
such instruments are used for the measurement of very high voltages.
There are two general types of such instruments :
(i) the quadrant type-used upto 20 kV. (ii) the attracted disc type – used upto 500 kV.
10.31. Attracted-disc Type Voltmeter
As shown in Fig. 10.40, it consists of two-discs or plates
C and D mounted parallel to each other. Plate D is fixed
and is earthed while C suspended by a coach spring, the
support for which carries a micrometer head for adjust-
ment. Plate C is connected to the positive end of the sup-
ply voltage. When a p.d. (whether direct or alternating) is
applied between the two plates, then C is attracted towards
D but may be returned to its original position by the mi-
crometer head. The movement of this head can be made to
indicate the force F with which C is pulled downwards.
For this purpose, the instrument can be calibrated by plac-
ing known weights in turn on C and observing the move-
Fig. 10.40
ment of micrometer head necessary to bring C back to its
original position. Alternatively, this movement of plate C is balanced by a control device which
actuates a pointer attached to it that sweeps over a calibrated scale.
There is a guard ring G surrounding the plate C and separated from it by a small air-gap. The
ring is connected electrically to plate C and helps to make the field uniform between the two plates.
The effective area of plate C, in that case, becomes equal to its actual area plus half the area of the air-
gap.
Theory
In Fig. 10.41 are shown two parallel plates separated by a distance of x meters. Suppose the
lower plate is fixed and carries a charge of − Q coulomb whereas the upper plate is movable and406 Electrical Technology
carries a charge of + Q coulomb. Let the mutual force of
attraction between the two plates be F newtons. Suppose the
upper plates is moved apart by a distance dx. Then mechanical
work done during this movement is F × dx joule. Since charge
on the plate is constant, no electrical energy can move into
the system from outside. This work is done at the case of the
energy stored in the parallel-plate capacitor formed by the
two plates.
Before movement, let the capacitance of the capacitor be

Initial energy stored = 1 .

If the capacitance changes to (C + dC) because of the movement of plate, then

Hence, we find that force is directly proportional to the square of the voltage to be measured.
The negative sign merely shows that it is a force of attraction.
10.32. Quadrant Type Voltmeters
The working principle and basic construction of such instruments can be understood from Fig.
10.42. A light aluminium vane C is mounted on a spindle S and is situated partially within a hollow
metal quadrant B. Alternatively, the vane be suspended in the quadrant. When the vane and the
quadrant are oppositely charged by the voltage under measurement, the vane is further attracted
inwards into the quadrant thereby causing the spindle and hence the pointer to rotate. The amount of
rotation and hence the deflecting torque is found proportional to V2. The deflecting torque in the case
of arrangement shown in Fig. 10.42 is very small unless V is extremely large.
Fig. 10.42 Fig. 10.43
The force on the vane may be increased by using a larger number of quadrants and a double-ended
vane. In Fig. 10.43 are shown four fixed metallic double quadrants arranged so as to form a circular
box with short air-gaps between the quadrants in which is suspended or pivoted as aluminium vane.
Opposite quadrants AA and BB are joined together and each pair is connected to on terminal of theElectrical Instruments and Measurements 407
a.c. or d.c. supply and at the same time, one pair is connected to the moving vane M. Under these
conditions [Fig. 10.43.] the moving vane is recalled by quadrants AA and attracted by quadrants BB.
Hence, a deflecting torque is produced which is proportional to (p.d.)2. Therefore, such voltmeters
have an uneven scale. Controlling torque is produced by torsion of the suspension spring or by the
spring (used in pivoted type voltmeters). Damping is by a disc or vane immersed in oil in the case of
suspended type or by air friction in the case of pivoted type instruments.
Theory
With reference to Fig 10.42, suppose the quadrant and vane are connected across a source of V
volts and let the resulting deflection be θ. If C is a capacitance between the quadrant and vane in the
deflected position, then the charge on the instrument will be CV coulomb. Suppose that the voltage is
charged from V to (V + dV), then as a result, let θ, C and Q charge to (θ + dθ), (C + dC) and
(Q + dQ) respectively. Then, the energy stored in the electrostatic field is increased by
dE = d 1 CV2 1 V2.dC C.V dV joule
2 2
If T is the value of controlling torque corresponding to a deflection of θ, then the additional
energy stored in the control will be T × dθ joule.
Total increase in stored energy = T ×dθ+ 1 V2 dC +CVdV joule
2
It is seen that during this charge, the source supplies a change dQ at potential V. Hence, the value
of energy supplied is
= V × dQ = V × d (CV) = V2 × dC + CV. dV
Since the energy supplied by the source must be equal to the extra energy stored in the field and
the control
∴ T ×dθ+ 1 V2 dC +CV.dV =V2.dC +CVdV
2
or T d 1 V2.dC T V2 dC N-m
2 2 d
The torque is found to be proportional to the square of the voltage to be measured whether that
voltage is alternating or direct. However, in alternating circuits the scale will read r.m.s. values.
10.33. Kelvin’s Multicellular Voltmeter
As shown in Fig. 10.44, it is essentially a quadrant type instrument, as described above, but with
the difference that instead of four quadrants and one vane, it has a large number of fixed quadrants
and vanes mounted on the same spindle. In this way, the deflecting torque for a given voltage is
increased many times. Such voltmeters can be used to measure voltages as low as 30 V. As said
above, this reduction in the minimum limit of voltage is due to the increasing operating force in
proportion to the number of component units. Such an instrument has a torsion head for zero adjustment
and a coach spring for protection against accidental fracture of suspension due to vibration etc. There
is a pointer and scale of edgewise pattern and damping is by a vane immersed in an oil dashpot.
10.34. Advantages and Limitation of Electrostatic Voltmeters
Some of the main advantages and use of electrostatic voltmeters are as follows :
1. They can be manufactured with first grade accuracy.
2. They give correct reading both on d.c. and a.c. circuits. On a.c. circuits, the scale will,
however, read r.m.s. values whatever the wave-form.
3. Since no iron is used in their construction, such instruments are free from hysteresis and
eddy current losses and temperature errors.
4. They do not draw any continuous current on d.c. circuits and that drawn on a.c. circuits (due
to the capacitance of the instrument) is extremely small. Hence, such voltmeters do not
cause any disturbance to the circuits to which they are connected.408 Electrical Technology
5. Their power loss is negligibly small.
6. They are unaffected by stray magnetic fields although
they have to be guarded against any stray electrostatic
field.
7. They can be used upto 1000 kHz without any serious
loss of accuracy.
However, their main limitations are :
1. Low-voltage voltmeters (like Kelvin’s Multicellular
voltmeter) are liable to friction errors.
2. Since torque is proportional to the square of the voltage,
their scales are not uniform although some uniformity
can be obtained by suitably shaping the quadrants of
the voltmeters.
3. They are expensive and cannot be made robust.
10.35. Range Extension of Electrostatic
Voltmeters Fig. 10.44
The range of such voltmeters can be extended by the use of multipliers which are in the form of
a resistance potential divider or capacitance potential divider. The former method can be used both
for direct and alternating voltages whereas the latter method is useful only for alternating voltages.
(i) Resistance Potential Divider
This divider consists of a high non-inductive resistance across a small portion which is attached
to the electrostatic voltmeter as shown in Fig. 10.45. Let R be the
resistance of the whole of the potential divider across which is
applied the voltage V under measurement. Suppose V is the maxi-
mum value of the voltage which the voltmeter can measure with-
out the multiplier. If r is the resistance of the portion of the di-
vider across which voltmeter is connected, then the multiplying
factor is given by
V R
=
v r
The above expression is true for d.c. circuits but for a.c. cir-
cuits, the capacitance of the voltmeter (which is in parallel with r)
has to be taken into account. Since this capacitance is variable, it
Fig. 10.45
is advisable to calibrate the voltmeter along with its multiplier.
(ii) Capacitance Potential Divider
In this method, the voltmeter may be connected in
series with a single capacity C and put across the volt-
age V which is to be measured [Fig. 10.46 (a)] or a
number of capacitors may be joined in series to form
the potential divider and the voltmeter may be con-
nected across one of the capacitors as shown in Fig.
10.46 (b).
Consider the connection shown in Fig. 10.46 (a).
It is seen that the multiplying factor is given by

Example 10.20. The reading ‘100’ of a 120-V electrosatatic voltmeter is to represent 10,000
volts when its range is extended by the use of a capacitor in series. If the capacitance of the voltme-
ter at the above reading is 70 μμF, find the capacitance of the capacitor multiplier required.
Solution. Multiplying factor =V =1+ C v

Here, V = 10,000 volt, v = 100 volts ; C = capacitance of the voltmeter = 70μμ F

or 70/C = 99 ∴ C = 70/99 μμ F = 0.707 μμ F (approx)
Example 10.21 (a). An electrostatic voltmeter is constructed with 6 parallel, semicircular fixed
plates equal-spaced at 4 mm intervals and 5 interleaved semi-circular movable plates that move in
planes midway between the fixed plates, in air. The movement of the movable plates is about an axis
through the center of the circles of the plates system, perpendicular to the planes of the plates. The
instrument is spring-controlled. If the radius of the movable plates is 4 cm, calculate the spring
constant if 10 kV corresponds to a full-scale deflection of 100°. Neglect fringing, edge effects and
plate thickness. (Elect. Measurements, Bombay Univ.)
Solution. Total number of plates (both fixed and movable) is 11, hence there are 10 parallel
plate capacitors.
Suppose, the movable plates are rotated into the fixed plates by an angle of θ radian. Then,
overlap area between one fixed and one movable semi-circular plate is
A= 1 r2θ= 1×0.042×θ=8×10 −4 θm2;d =4/2=2mm=2×10 −3m

Here, θ = 100° = 100 × π/180 = 5π/9 radian
∴ S × 5π/9 = 17.7 × 10 − 4 ∴ S = 10.1 × 10−−−−− 4 N-m/rad.
Example 10.21 (b). A capacitance transducer of two parallel plates of overlapping area of
5 × 10 − 4 m2 is immersed in water. The capacitance ‘C’ has been found to be 9.50 pF. Calculate the

10.36.Wattmeters
We will discuss the two main types of wattmeters in general use, that is, (i) the dynamometer or
electrodynamic type and (ii) the induction type.
10.37.Dynamometer Wattmeter
The basic principle of dynamometer instrument has already been explained in detail in Art.
10.20. The connections of a dynamometer type wattmeter are shown in Fig. 10.47. The fixed
Fig. 10.47 Fig. 10.48
circular coil which carries the main circuit current I is wound in two halves positioned parallel to
1
each other. The distance between the two halves can be adjusted to give a uniform magnetic field.
The moving coil which is pivoted centrally carries a current I which is proportional to the voltage V.
2
Current I is led into the moving coil by two springs which also supply the necessary controlling
2
torque. The equivalent diagrammatic view is shown in Fig. 10.48.
Deflecting Torque
Since coils are air-cored, the flux density produced is directly proportional to the current I .
1
∴ B ∝ I or B = K I ; current I ∝ V or I = K V
1 1 1 2 2 2
Now T ∝ BI ∝ I V ∴ T = KV I = K × power
d 2 1 d 1
In d.c. circuits, power is given by the product of voltage and current in amperes, hence torque is
directly proportional to the power.
Let us see how this instrument indicates true power on a.c. circuits.
For a.c. supply, the value of instantaneous torque is given by T ∝ vi = K vi
inst
where v = instantaneous value of voltage across the moving coil
i = instantaneous value of current through the fixed coils.
However, owing to the large inertia of the moving system, the instrument indicates the mean or
average power.
∴ Mean deflecting torque T ∝ average value of υi

where V and I are the r.m.s. values. ∴ T ∝ VI cos φ ∝ true power.
m
Hence, we find that in the case of a.c. supply also, the deflection is proportional to the true power
in the circuit.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 411
Scales of dynamometer wattmeters are more or less
uniform because the deflection is proportional to the
average power and for spring control, controlling torque
is proportional to the deflection. Hence θ ∝ power.
Damping is pneumatic with the help of a piston moving
in an air chamber as shown in Fig. 10.49.
Errors
The inductance of the moving or voltage coil is
liable to cause error but the high non-inductive resis-
tance connected in series with the coil swamps, to a
great extent, the phasing effect of the voltage-coil in-
Fig. 10.49
ductance.
Another possible error in the indicated power may be due to (i) some voltage drop in the circuit
or (ii) the current taken by the voltage coil. In standard wattmeters, this defect is overcome by having
an additional compensating winding which is connected in series with the voltage coil but is so placed
that is produces a field in opposite direction to that of the fixed or current coils.
Advantages and Disadvantages
By careful design, such instruments can be built to give a very high degree of accuracy. Hence
they are used as a standard for calibration purposes. They are equally accurate on d.c. as well as a.c.
circuits.
However, at low power factors, the inductance of the voltage coil causes serious error unless
special precautions are taken to reduce this effect [Art. 10.38 (ii)].
10.38.Wattmeter Errors
(i) Error Due to Different Connections
Two possible ways of connecting a wattmeter in a single-phase a.c. circuit are shown in Fig.
10.50 along with their phasor diagrams. In Fig. 10.50 (a), the pressure or voltage-coil current does
not pass through the current coil of the wattmeter whereas in the connection of Fig. 10.50 (b) is
passes. A wattmeter is supposed to indicate the power consumed by the load but its actual reading is
slightly higher due to power losses in the instrument circuits. The amount of error introduced depends
on the connection.
(a) Consider the connection of Fig. 10.50 (a). If cos φ is the power factor of the load, then
power in the load is VI cos θ.
Now, voltage across the pressure-coil of the wattmeter is V which is the phasor sum of the load
1
voltage V and p.d. across current-coil of the instrument i.e. V′ (= Ir where r is the resistance of the
current coil).
Hence, power reading as indicated by the wattmeter is = V I cos θ
1
where θ = phase difference between V and I as shown in the phasor diagram of Fig. 10.50 (a).
1
As seen from the phasor diagram, V cos θ = (V cos φ + V′)
1
∴wattmeter reading = V cos θ . I = (V cos φ + V′ ) I
1
= VI cos φ + V′ I = VI cos φ + I2r = power in load + power in current coil.
(b) Next, consider the connection of Fig. 10.50 (b). The current through the current-coil of the
wattmeter is the phasor sum of load current I and voltage-coil current I′ = V/R. The power reading
indicated by the wattmeter is = VI cos θ.
1
As seen from the phasor diagram of Fig. 10.50 (b), I cos θ = (I cos φ + I′ )
1
∴ wattmeter reading = V (I cos φ + I′ ) = VI cos φ + VI′ = VI cos φ + V2/R
= power in load + power in pressure-coil circuit412 Electrical Technology
Fig. 10.50
(ii) Error Due to Voltage-coil Inductance
While developing the theory of electrodynamic instruments, it was assumed that pressure-coil
does not posses any inductance (and hence reactance) so that current drawn by it was = V/R. The
wattmeter reading is proportional to the mean deflecting torque, which is itself proportional to I I
1 2
cos θ, where θ is the angle between two currents (Fig. 10.52).
In case the inductance of the voltage-coil is neglected.

(iii) Error Due to Capacitance in Voltage-coil Circuit
There is always present a small amount of capacitance in the voltage-coil circuit, particularly in
the series resistor. Its effect is to reduce angle α and thus reduce error due to the inductance of the
voltage coil circuit. In fact, in some wattmeters, a small capacitor is purposely connected in parallel
with the series resistor for obtaining practically non-inductive voltage-coil circuit. Obviously, over-
compensation will make resultant reactance capacitive thus making α negative in the above expres-
sions.
(iv) Error Due to Stray Fields
Since operating field of such an instrument is small, it is very liable to stray field errors. Hence,
it should be kept as far away as possible from stray fields. However, errors due to stray fields are, in
general, negligible in a properly-constructed instrument.
(v) Error Due to Eddy Currents
The eddy current produced in the solid metallic parts of the instrument by the alternating field of
the current coil changes the magnitude and strength of this operating field thus producing an error in
the reading of the wattmeter. This error is not easily calculable although it can be serious if care is not
taken to remove away solid masses of metal from the proximity of the current coil.
Example 10.22. A dynamometer type wattmeter with its voltage coil connected across the load
side of the instrument reads 250 W. If the load voltage be 200 V, what power is being taken by load?
The voltage coil branch has a resistance of 2,000 Ω.
(Elect. Engineering, Madras Univ.)414 Electrical Technology
Solution. Since voltage coil is connected across the load side of
the wattmeter (Fig. 10.53), the power consumed by it is also included
in the meter reading.
Power consumed by voltage coil is
= V2/R = 2002/2,000 = 20 W
∴ Power being taken by load = 250 − 20
= 230 W

ter has resistance of current and potential coils of 0.5 and 12,500 Fig. 10.53

unity p.f. loads at 250 volts are of (a) 4A (b) 12 A.
Neglect the error due to the inductance of pressure coil.
(Elect. Measurements, Pune. Univ.)
Solution. (a) When I = 4 A
(i) Consider the type of connection shown in Fig. 10.50 (a)
Power loss in current coil of wattmeter = I2r = 42 × 0.5 = 8 W
Load power = 250 × 4 × 1 = 1000 W ; Wattmeter reading = 1008 W
∴ percentage error = (8/1008) × 100 = 0.794%
(ii) Power loss in pressure coil resistance = V2/R = 2502/12,500 = 5 W
∴ Percentage error = 5 × 100/1005 = 0.497 %
(b) When I = 12 A
(i) Power loss in current coil = 122 × 0.5 = 72 W
Load power = 250 × 12 × 1 = 3000 W ; wattmeter reading = 3072 W
∴ percentage error = 72 × 100/3072 = 2.34 %
(ii) Power loss in the resistance of pressure coil is 2502/12,500 = 5 W
∴ percentage error = 5 × 100/3005 = 0.166 %
Example 10.24. An electrodynamic wattmeter has a voltage circuit of resistance of 8000 Ω and
inductance of 63.6 mH which is connected directly across a load carrying a current of 8A at a 50-Hz
voltage of 240-V and p.f. of 0.1 lagging. Estimate the percentage error in the wattmeter reading
caused by the loading and inductance of the voltage
circuit.
(Elect & Electronic Measu. & Instru. Nagpur, Univ. 1992)
Solution. The circuit connections are shown in Fig.

Load power = 240 × 8 × 0.1 = 192 W

Neglecting the inductance of the voltage coil, the wattmeter reading would be

Example. 10.26. The current coil of wattmeter is connected in series with an ammeter and an
inductive load. A voltmeter and the voltage circuit of the wattmeter are connected across a 400-Hz

and 29 W. The inductance of the voltage circuit is 5 mH and its resistance is 4 kΩ. If the voltage

10.39. Induction Wattmeters
Principle of induction wattmeters is the same as that of induction ammeters and voltmeters.
They can be used on a.c. supply only in constant with dynamometer wattmeters, which can be used
both on d.c. and a.c. supply. Induction wattmeters are useful only when the frequency and supply
voltage are constant.416 Electrical Technology
Since, both a current and a pressure element are required in such instrument, it is not essential to
use the shaded-pole principle. Instead of this, two separate a.c. magnets are used, which produce two
fluxes, which have the required phase difference.
Construction
The wattmeter has two laminated elec-
tromagnets, one of which is excited by the
current in the main circuit-exciting wind-
ing being joined in series with the circuit,
hence it is also called a series magnet. The
other is excited by current which is propor-
tional to the voltage of the circuit. Its ex-
citing coil is joined in parallel with the cir-
cuit, hence this magnet is sometimes re-
ferred to as shunt magnet.
A thin aluminium disc is so mounted
that it cuts the fluxes of both magnets.
Hence, two eddy currents are produced in
the disc. The deflection torque is produced
due to the interaction of these eddy current
and the inducing fluxes. Two or three cop-
Fig. 10.56
per rings are fitted on the central limb of
the shunt magnet and can be so adjusted as
to make the resultant flux in the shunt magnet lag behind the applied voltage by 90º.
Two most common forms of the electromagnets are shown in Fig. 10.56 and 10.57. It is seen that
in both cases, one magnet is placed above and the other below the disc. The magnets are so posi-
tioned and shaped that their fluxes are cut by the disc.
In Fig. 10.56, the two pressure coils are joined in series and are so wound that both send the flux
through the central limb in the same direction. The series magnet carries two coils joined in series
and so wound that they magnetise their respective cores in the same direction. Correct phase dis-
placement between the shunt and series magnet fluxes can be obtained by adjusting the position of the
copper shading bands as shown.
In the type of instrument shown in Fig. 10.57, there is only one pressure winding and one current
winding. The two projecting poles of the shunt magnet are surrounded by a copper shading band
whose position can be adjusted for correcting the phase of the flux of this magnet with respect to the
voltage.
Both types of induction wattmeters
shown above, are spring-controlled, the
spring being fitted to the spindle of the
moving system which also carries the
pointer. The scale is uniformly even and
extends over 300º.
Currents upto 100 A can be handled
by such wattmeters directly but for currents
greater than this value, they are used in con-
junction with current transformers. The
pressure coil is purposely made as much
inductive as possible in order that the flux
through it should lag behind the voltage by
90º.
Theory Fig. 10.57
The winding of one magnet carries line current I so that Φ ∝ I and is in phase with I (Fig. 10.58).
1Electrical Instruments and Measurements 417
The other coil i.e., pressure or voltage coil is made highly inductive having
an inductance of L and and negligible resistance. This is connected across
the supply voltage V. The current in the pressure coil is therefore, equal to
V/ωL. Hence, Φ ∝ V/ωL and lags behind the voltage by 90º. Let the load
2
current I lag behind V by φ i.e., let the load power factor angle be φ. As
shown in Fig. 10.56, the phase angle between Φ and Φ is α = (90 − φ).
1 2
The value of the torque acting on the disc is given by
T = kω Φ Φ sin α – Art. 10.25 Fig. 10.58
1m 2m
or T ∝ 2 ω.I. V .sin(90−φ)∝ VI cos φ ∝ power
ωL
Hence, the torque is proportional to the power in the load circuit. For spring control, the control-
ling torque T ∝ θ. ∴ θ ∝ power. Hence, the scale is even.

10.40. Advantage and Limitations of Induction Wattmeters
These wattmeters possess the advantages of fairly long scales (extending over 300º), are free
from the effects of stray fields and have good damping. They are practically free from frequency
errors. However, they are subject to (sometimes) serious temperature errors because the main effect
of temperature is on the resistance of the eddy current paths.
10.41. Energy Meters
Energy meters are integrating instruments, used to measure quantity of electric energy supplied
to a circuit in a given time. They give no direct indication of power i.e., as to the rate at which energy
is being supplied because their registrations are independent of the rate at which a given quantity of
electric energy is being consumed. Supply or energy meters are generally of the following types :
(i) Electrolytic meters - their operation depends on electrolytic action.
(ii) Motor meters - they are really small electric motors.
(iii) Clock meters - they function as clock mechanisms.
10.42. Electrolytic Meter
It is used on d.c. circuits* only and is essentially an ampere-hour meter and not a true watt-hour
meter. However, its registrations are converted into watt-hour by multiplying them by the voltage
(assumed constant) of the circuits in which it is used. Such instruments are usually calibrated to read
kWh directly at the declared voltage. Their readings would obviously be incorrect when used on any
other voltage. Because of the question of power factor, such instrument cannot be used on a.c.
circuits.
The advantages of simplicity, cheapness and of low power consumption of ampere-hour meters
are, to a large extent, discounted by the fact that variations in supply voltage are not taken into
account by them. As an example suppose that the voltage of a supply whose nominal value is
220 V, has an average value of 216 volts in one hour during which a consumer draws a current of 100
A. Quantity of electricity as measured by the instrument which is calibrated on 220 V, is 220 × 100/
1000 = 22 kWh. Actually, the energy consumed by the customer is only 216 × 100/1000 = 21.6 kWh.
Obviously, the consumer is being overcharged to the extent of the cost of 22 − 21.6 = 0.4 kWh of
energy per hour. A true watthour-meter would have taken into account the decrease in the supply
voltage and would have, therefore, resulted in a saving to the consumer. If the supply voltage would
* Recently such instruments have been marketed for measurement of kilovoltampere-hours on a.c. supply,
using a small rectifier unit, which consists of a current transformer and full-wave copper oxide rectifier.418 Electrical Technology
have been higher by that amount, then the supply company would have been the loser (Ex. 10.27).
In this instrument, the operating current is passed through a suitable electrolyte contained in a
voltmeter. Due to electrolysis, a deposit of mercury is given or a gas is liberated (depending on the
type of meter) in proportion to the quantity of electricity passed (Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis).
The quantity of electricity passed is indicated by the level of mercury in a graduated tube. Hence,
such instruments are calibrated in amp-hour or if constancy of supply voltage is assumed, are calibrated
in watt-hour or kWh.
Such instruments are cheap, simple and are accurate even at very small loads. They are not
affected by stray magnetic fields and due to the absence of any moving parts are free from friction
errors.
10.43. Motor Meters
Most commonly-used instruments of this type are :
(i) Mercury motor meters (ii) Commutator motor meters and (ii) Induction motor meters.
Of these, mercury motor meter is normally used on d.c. circuits whereas the induction type
instrument is used only on a.c. circuits. However, the commutator type meter can be used both for
d.c. as well as a.c. work.
Instruments used for d.c. work can be either in the form of a amp-hour meters or watt-hour
meters. In both cases, the moving system is allowed to revolve continuously instead of being merely
allowed to deflect or rotate through a fraction of a revolution as in indicating instruments. The speed
of rotation is directly proportional to the current in the case of amp-hour meter and to power in the
case of watt-hour meter. Hence the number of revolutions made in a given time is proportional, in the
case of amp-hour meter, to the quantity of electricity (Q = i × t) and in the case of Wh meter, to the
quantity of energy supplied to the circuit. The number of revolutions made are registered by a count-
ing mechanism consisting of a train of gear wheels and dials.
The control of speed of the rotating system is brought about by a permanent magnet (known as
braking magnet) which is so placed as to set up eddy currents in some parts of the rotating system.
These eddy currents produce a retarding torque which is proportional to their magnitude-their magni-
tude itself depending on the speed of rotation of the rotating system. The rotating system attains a
steady speed when the braking torque exactly balances the driving torque which is produced either by
the current or power in the circuit.
The essential parts of motor meters are :
1. An operating system which produces an operating torque proportional to the current or
power in the circuit and which causes the rotation of the rotating system.
2. A retarding or braking device, usually a permanent magnet, which produces a braking torque
is proportional to the speed of rotation. Steady speed of rotation is achieved when braking torque
becomes equal to the operating torque.
3. A registering mechanism for the revolutions of the rotating system. Usually, it consists of a
train of wheels driven by the spindle of the rotating system. A worm which is cut on the spindle
engages a pinion and so driven a wheel-train.
10.44. Errors in Motor Meters
The two main errors in such instruments are : (i) friction error and (ii) braking error. Friction
error is of much more importance in their case than the corresponding error in indicating instruments
because (a) it operates continuously and (b) it affects the speed of the rotor. The braking action in
such meters corresponding to damping in indicating instruments. The braking torque directly affects
the speed for a given driving torque and also the number of revolution made in a given time.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 419
Friction torque can be compensated for providing a small constant driving torque which is ap-
plied to the moving system independent of the load.
As said earlier, steady speed of such instruments is reached when driving torque is euqal to the
braking torque. The braking torque is proportional to the flux of the braking magnet and the eddy
current induced in the moving system due to its rotation in the field of the braking magnet
∴ T ∝ Φ
B i
where Φ is the flux of the braking magnet and i the induced current. Now i = e/R where e is the
induced e.m.f. and R the resistance of the eddy current path. Also e ∝ Φ n where n is the speed of the
moving part of the instrument.
∴ T α n
2n
b R R
The torque T ′ at the steady speed of N is given T ′ ∝ Φ2 N/R
B B
Now T′ = T – the driving torque
B D
∴ T ∝ Φ2 N/R or N ∝ T R/Φ2
D D
Hence for a given driving torque, the steady speed is direcly proportional to the resistance of the
eddy current of path and inversely to the square of the flux.
Obviously, it is very important that the strength of the field of the brake magnet should be con-
stant throughout the time the meter is in service. The constancy of field strengths can be assured by
careful design treatment during the manufacturing of the brake magnet. Variations in temperature
will affect the braking torque since the resistance of the eddy current path will change. This error is
difficult to fully compensate for.
10.45. Quantity or ampere-hour Meters
The use of such meters is mostly confined to d.c. circuits. Their operation depends on the
production of two torques (i) a driving torque which is proportional to the current I in the circuit and
(ii) a braking torque which is proportional to the speed n of the spindle. This speed attains a steady
value N when these two torques become numerically equal. In that case, speed becomes proportional
to current i.e., N ∝ I. Over a certain period of time, the total number of revolutions ∫ Ndt will be
∫
proportional to the quantity of electricity Idt passing through the meter. A worm cut in the spindle
as its top engages gear wheels of the recording mechanism which has suitably marked dials reading
directly in ampere hours. Since electric supply charges are based on watt-hour rather than ampere-
hours, the dials of ampere-hour meters are frequently marked in corresponding watt-hour at the normal
supply voltage. Hence, their indications of watt-hours are correct only when the supply voltages
remains constant, otherwise reading will be wrong.
10.46. Ampere-hour Mercury Motor Meter
It is one of the best and most popular forms of mercury Ah meter used for d.c. work.
Construction
It consists of a thin Cu disc D mounted at the base of a spindle, working in jewelled cup bearings
and revolving between a pair of permanent magnets M and M . One of the two magnets i.e., M is
1 2 2
used for driving purposes whereas M is used for braking. In between the poles of M and M is a
1 1 2
hollow circular box B in which rotates the Cu disc and the rest of the space is filled up with mercury
which exerts considerable upward thrust on the disc, thereby reducing the pressure on the bearings.
The spindle is so weighted that it just sinks in the mercury bath. A worm cut in the spindle at its top
engages the gear wheels of the recording mechanism as shown in Fig. 10.59.420 Electrical Technology
Fig. 10.59 Fig. 10.60
Principle of Action
Its principle of action can be understood from Fig. 10.61 which shows a separate line drawing of
the motor element.
The current to be measured is led into the
disc through the mercury at a point at its
circumference on the right-hand side. As
shown by arrows, it flows radially to the
centre of the disc where it passes out to the
external circuit through the spindle and its
bearings. It is worth noting that current
flows takes place only under the right-
hand side magnet M and not under the left-
2
hand side magnet M . The field of M will,
1 2
therefore, exert a force on the right-side
portion of the disc which carries the cur-
rent (motor action). The direction of the
Fig. 10.61
force, as found by Fleming’s Left-hand rule,
is as shown by the arrow. The magnitude of the force depends on the flux density and current (ä F
= BIl). The driving or motoring torque T so produced is given by the product of the force and the
d
distance from the spindle at which this force acts. When the disc rotates under the influence of this
torque, it cuts through the field of left-hand side magnet M and hence eddy currents are produced in
1
it which results in the production of braking torque. The magnitude of the retarding or braking torque
is proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc.
Theory
Driving torque T ∝ force on the disc × B I
d
If the flux density of M remains constant, then T ∝ I.

The braking torque T is proportional to the flux Φ of braking magnet M and eddy current i

Now i = e/R where e is the induced e.m.f. and R the resistance of eddy current path.

10.47.Friction Compensation
There are two types of frictions in this ampere-hour meter.
(i) Bearing Friction. The effect of this friction is normally negligible because the disc and
spindle float in mercury. Due to the upward thrust, the pressure on bearings is considerably
reduced which results in freedom from wear as well as freat reduction in the bearing friction.
(ii) Mercury Friction. Since the disc revolves in mer-
cury, there is friction between mercury and the disc,
which gives rise to a torque, approximately proportional
to the square of the speed of rotation. Hence, this fric-
tion causes the meter to run shown on heavy loads. It
can be compensated for in the following two ways :
(a) a coil of few turns is wound on one of the poles of the
driving magnet M and the meter current is passed
2
through it in a suitable direction so as to increase the
strength of M . The additional driving torque so pro-
2
duced can be made just sufficient to compensate for
the mercury friction.
(b) in the other method, two iron bars are placed across the
permanent magnets, one above and other one below Fig. 10.62
the mercury chamber as shown in Fig. 10.62. The lower
bar carries a small compensating coil through which is passed the load current. The local
magnetic field set up by this coil strengthens the field of driving magnet M and weakens
2
that of the braking magnet M , thereby compensating for mercury friction.
1
10.48.Mercury Meter Modified as Watt-hour meter
If the permanent magnet M of the amp-hour meter, used for producing the driving torque, is
2
replaced by a wound electromagnet connected across the supply, the result is a watt-hour meter. The
exciting current of this electromagnet is proportional to the voltage of the supply. The driving torque
is exerted on the aluminium disc immersed in the mercury chamber below which is placed this elec-
tromagnet. The aluminimum disc has radial slots cut in it for ensuring the radial flow of current
through it the current being led into and out of this disc through mercury contacts situated at
diameterically opposite points. These radial slots, moreover, prevent the same disc being used for
braking purposes. Braking is by a separate aluminium disc mounted on the same spindle and revolv-
ing in the air-gap of a separate braking magnet.
10.49.Commutator Motor Meters
These meters may be either ampere-hour or
true watt-hour meters. In Fig. 10.63 is shown the
principle of a common type of watt-hour meter
known as Elihu-Thomson meter. It is based on the
dynamometer principle (Art. 10.20) and is essen-
tially an ironless motor with a wound armature hav-
ing a commutator.
Construction
There are two fixed coils C and C each con-
1 2
sisting of a few turns of heavy copper strip and
joined in series with each other and with the sup- Fig. 10.63
ply circuit so that they carry the main current in422 Electrical Technology
the circuit (a shunt is used if the current is too heavy). The field produced by them is proportional to
the current to be measured. In this field rotates an armature carrying a number of coils which are
connected to the segments of a small commutator. The armature coils are wound on a former made of
non-magnetic material and are connected through the brushes and in series with a large resistance
across the supply lines. The commutator is made of silver and the brushes are silver tipped in order
to reduce friction. Obviously, the current passing through the armature is proportional to the supply
voltage.
The operating torque is produced due to the reaction of the field produced by the fixed coils
and the armature coils. The magnitude of this torque is proportional to the product of the two currents
i.e.,
T ∝ φ I or T ∝ I × I (ä Φ ∝ I)
d 1 d 1
where I = main circuit current
I = current in armature coils.
1
since I ∝ V ∴ T ∝ V I -power
1 d
Brake torque is due to the eddy currents induced in an aluminium disc mounted on the same
spindle and running in the air-gaps of two permanent magnets. As shown in Art, 10.44, this braking
torque is proportional to the speed of the disc if the flux of the braking magnet and the resistance of
the eddy current paths are assumed constant.
When steady speed of rotation is reached, then
T = T ∴ N ∝ VI ∝ power W
B d ∫
Hence, steady number of revolutions in a given time is proportional to Wt = the energy in the
circuit.
The friction effect is compensated for by means of a small compensating coil placed coaxially
with the two currents coils and connected in series with the armature such that it strengthens the field
of current coil. But its position is so adjusted that with zero line current the armature just fails to
rotate. Such meters are now employed mainly for switchboard use, house service meters being
invariably of the mercury ampere-hour type.
10.50. Induction Type Single-phase
Watthour Meter
Induction type meters are, by far, the most common
form of a.c. meters met with in every day domestic and
industrial installations. These meters measure electric
energy in kilo-watthours. The principle of these meters
is practically the same as that of the induction wattme-
ters. Constructionally, the two are similar that the con-
trol spring and the pointer of the watt-meter are replaced,
in the case of watthour meter, by a brake magnet and by
a spindle of the meter.
The brake magnet induces eddy currents in the disc
which revolves continuously instead of rotating through
only a fraction of a revolution as in the case of wattmeters.
Construction
The meter consists of two a.c. electromagnets as
shown in Fig. 10.64. (a), one of which i.e., M is excited
1

alternating flux Φ produced by it is proportional to and

hysteresis and iron saturation are neglected). The winding of the other magnet M called shunt
2
magnet, is connected across the supply line and carries current proportional to the supply voltage V.
The flux Φ produced by it is proportional to supply voltage V and lags behind it by 90º. This phase
2
displacement of exact 90º is achieved by adjustment of the copper shading band C (also known as
power factor compensator) on the shunt magnet M . Major portion of Φ crosses the narrow gap
2 2
between the centre and side limbs of M but a small amount, which is the useful flux, passes through
2
the disc D. The two fluxes Φ and Φ induce e.m.f.s in the disc which further produce the circulatory
1 2
eddy currents. The reaction between these fluxes and eddy currents produces the driving torque on
the disc in a manner similar to that explained in Art. 10.39. The braking torque is produced by a pair
of magnets [Fig. 10.64 (b)] which are mounted diametrically opposite to the magnets M and M .

The register mechanism is either of pointer
type of cyclometer type. In the former type, the
pinion on the rotor shaft drives, with the help of
a suitable train of reduction gears, a series of five
or six pointers rotating on dials marked with ten
equal divisions. The gearing between different
pointers is such that each pointer advances by
1/10th of a revolution for a complete revolution

the train of gearing as shown in Fig. 10.65.
Theory
As shown in Art. 10.39. and with reference to Fig. 10.58, the driving torque is given by

10.51. Errors in Induction Watthour Meters
1. Phase and speed errors
Because ordinary the flux due to shunt magnet does not lag behind the supply voltage by exactly
90º owing to the fact that the coil has some resistance, the torque is not zero power factor. This is
compensated for by means of an adjustable shading ring placed over the central limb of the sunt
magnet. That is why this shading ring is known as power factor compensator.424 Electrical Technology
An error in the speed of the meter, when tested on a non-inductive load, can be eliminated by
correctly adjusting the position of the brake magnet. Movement of the poles of the braking magnet
towards the centre of the disc reduces the braking torque and vice-versa.
The supply voltage, the full load current and the correct number of revolutions per kilowatthour
are indicated on the name plate of the meter.
2. Friction compensation and creeping error
Frictional forces at the rotor bearings and in the register mechanism gives rise to unwanted
braking torque on the disc rotor. This can be reduced to an unimportant level by making the ratio of
the shunt magnet flux Φ and series magnet flux Φ large with the help of two shading bands. These
2 1
bands embrace the flux contained in the two outer limbs of the shunt magnet and so eddy currents are
induced in them which cause phase displacement between the enclosed flux and the main-gap flux.
As a result of this, a small driving torque is exerted on the disc rotor solely by the pressure coil and
independent of the main driving torque. The amount of this corrective torque is adjusted by the
variation of the position of the two bands, so as to exactly compensate for firctional torque in the
instrument. Correctness of friction compensation is achieved when the rotor does not run on no-load
with only the supply voltage connected.
By ‘creeping’ is meant the slow but continuous rotation of the rotor when only the pressure coils
are excited but with no current flowing in the circuit. It may be caused due to various factors like
incorrect friction compensation, to vibration, to stray magnetic fields or due to the voltage supply
being is excess of the normal. In order to prevent creeping on no-load, two holes are drilled in the
disc on a diameter i.e., on the opposite sides of the spindle.
This causes sufficient distortion of the field to prevent rotation when one of the holes comes
under one of the poles of the sunt magnet.
3. Errors due to temperature variations
The errors due to temperature variations of the instruments are usually small, because the various
effects produced tend to neutralise one another.
Example 10.27. An ampere-hour meter, calibrated at 210 V, is used on 230 V circuit and
indicates a consumption of 730 units in a certain period. What is the actual energy supplied ?
If this period is reckoned as 200 hours, what is the average value of the current ?
(Elect. Technology, Utkal Univ.)
Solution. As explained in Art. 10.42, ampere-hour meters are calibrated to read directly in mWh
at the declared voltage. Obviously, their readings would be incorrect when used on any other volt-
age.
Reading on 210 volt = 730 kWh
Reading on 230 volt = 730 × 230/210 = 800 kWh (approx.)
Average current = 800,000/230 × 200 = 17.4 A
Example 10.28. In a test run of 30 min. duration with a constant current of 5 A, mercury-motor
amp-hour meter, was found to register 0.51 kWh. If the meter is to be used in a 200-V circuit, find its
error and state whether it is running fast or slow. How can the instrument be adjusted to read
correctly ? (Elect. Mean Inst. and Mean., Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. Ah passed in 30 minutes = 5 × 1/2 = 2.5
Assumed voltage = 0.51 × 1000/2.5 = 204 V
When used on 200-V supply, it would obviously show higher values because actual voltage is
less than the assumed voltage. It would be fast by 4 × 100/200 = 2%
Example 10.29. An amp-hour meter is calibrated to read kWh on a 220-V supply. In one part
of the gear train from the rotor to the first counting dial, there is a pinion driving a 75-tooth wheel.
Calculate the number of teeth on a wheel which is required to replace 75-tooth wheel, in order to
render the meter suitable for operation on 250-V supply.
Solution. An amp-hour meter, which is calibrated on 220-V supply would run fast when oper-
ated on 250-V supply in the ratio 250/220 or 25/22. Hence, to neutralize the effect of increasedElectrical Instruments and Measurements 425
voltage, the number of teeth in the wheel should be reduced by the same ratio.
∴ Teeth on the new wheel = 75 × 22/25 = 66
Example 10.30. A meter, whose constant is 600 revolutions per kWh, makes five revolution in
20 seconds. Calculate the load in kW. (Elect. Meas. and Meas. Inst. Gujarat Univ.)
Solution. Time taken to make 600 revolution is = 600 × 20/5 = 2,400 second
During this time, the load consumes 1 kWh of energy. If W is load in kW, then
W × 2400(60) × 60 = 1 or W = 1.5 kW
Example 10.31. A current of 6 A flows for 20 minutes through a 220-V ampere hour meter. If
during a test the initial and final readings on the meter are 3.53 and 4.00 kWh respectively, calculate
the meter error as a percentage of the meter readings.
If during the test, the spindle makes 480 revolutions, calculate the testing constant in coulomb/
rev and rev/kWh.
( )
Solution. Energy actually consumed =
6× 20 × 200 =0.44kWh
60 1000
Energy as registered by meter = 4.00 − 3.53 = 0.47 kWh
Error = 0.47 − 0.44 = 0.03 kWh ; % error = 0.03 × 100/0.47 = 6.38 %
No. of coulombs passed through in 20 minutes = 6 × 20 × 7,2000 coulomb
Testing for 480 revolutions, only 0.44 kWh are consumed, hence testing constant = 480/0.44 =
1091 rev/kWh.
Example 10.32. A 230-V, single-phase domestic energy meter has a constant load of 4 A pass-
ing through it for 6 hours at unity power factor. If the meter disc makes 2208 revolutions during this
period, what is the meter are 1472 when operating at 230 V and 5 V for 4 hours.
(Elect, Measure, A.M.I.E. Sec B, 1991)
Solution. Energy consumption in 6 hr = 230 × 4 × 1 × 6 = 5520 W = 5.52 kW
Meter constant = 2208/5.52 = 400 rev/kWh.
Now, 1472 revolution represents energy consumption of 1472/400 = 3.68 kWh
∴ VI cos φ × hours = 3.68 × 10 −10 or 230 × 5 × cos φ × 4 = 3680, ∴ cos φ = 0.8
Example 10.33. A 230 V, single-phase domestic energy meter has a constant load of 4 A pass-
ing through it for 6 hours at unity power factor. If the motor disc makes 2208 revolution during this
period, what is the constant in rev kWh ? Calculate the power factor of the load if the No. of rev
made by the meter are 1472 when operating at 230 V and 5 A for 4 hours.
(Elect. Measuring. AMIE Sec. Winter 1991)
Solution. Energy supplied at unity p.f. = 230 × 4 × 6 × 1/1000 = 5.52
∴ 230 × 5 × 4 × cos φ/2000 = 3.68 ∴ cos φ = 0.8.
Example 10.34. The testing constant of a supply meter of the amp-hour type is given as 60
coulomb/revolution. It is found that with a steady current of 50 A, the spindle makes 153 revolutions
in 3 minutes. Calculate the factor by which dial indications of the meter must be multiplied to give
the consumption. (City and Guilds, London)
Solution. Coulombs supplied in 3 min. = 50 × 3 × 60
At the rate of 60 C/rev., the correct of revolution should have been
= 50 × 3 × 60/60 = 150
Registered No. of revolutions = 153
Obviously, the meter is fact. The registered readings should be multiplied by 150/153 = 0.9804
for correction.
Example 10.35. A single phase kWhr meter makes 500 revolutions per kWh. It is found on
testing as making 40 revolutions in 58.1 seconds at 5 kW full load. Find out the percentage error.
(Elect. Measurement & Measuring Instrument Nagpur Univ. 1993)426 Electrical Technology
Solution. The number of revolutions the meter will make in one hour on testing = 40 × 3600/
58.1 = 2478.5
These revolutions correspond to an energy of 5 × 5 kWh
∴ No. of revolutions kWh = 2478.5/5 = 495.7
Percentage error = (500 − 495.7) × 100/500 = 0.86 %
Example 10.36. An energy meter is designed to make 100 revolution of the disc for one unit of
energy. Calculate the number of revolutions made by it when connected to a load carrying 40 A at
230-V and 0.4 power factor for an hour. If it actually makes 360 revolutions, find the percentage
error. (Elect. Engg - I Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. Energy consumed in one hour = 230 × 40 × 0.4 × 1/1000 = 3.68 kWh
No. of revolutions the meter should make if it is correct = 3.68 × 100 = 368
No. of revolutions actually made = 360
∴ Percentage error = (369 − 360) × 100/368 = 2.17 %
Example 10.37. The constant of a 25-ampere, 220-V meter is 500 rev/kWh. During a test at full
load of 4.400 watt, the disc makes a 50 revolutions in 83 seconds. Calculate the meter error.
Solution. In one hour, at full-load the meter should make (4400 × 1) × 500/1000 = 2200 revolu-
tions. This corresponds to a speed of 2200/60 = 36.7 r.p.m.
Correct time for 50 rev. = (50 × 60)/36.7 = 81.7s
Hence, meter is slow by 83 − 81.7 = 1.3 s
∴ Percentage error = 1.3 × 100/81.7 = 1.59 %
Example 10.38. A 16-A amp-hour meter with a dial marked in kWh, has an error of + 2.5 %
when used on 250-V circuit. Find the percentage error in the registration of the meter if it is con-
nected for an hour in series with a load taking 3.2 kW at 200.
Solution. In one hour, the reading given by the meter is = 16 × 250/1000 = 4 kWh
Correct reading = 4 + 2.5 % of 4 = 4.1 kWh
Meter current on a 3.2 kW load at 200 V = 3200/200 = 16 A
Since on the given load, meter current is the same as the normal current of the meter, hence in one
hour it would give a corrected reading of 4.1 kWh.
But actual load is 3.2 kWh. ∴ Error = 4.1 − 3.2 = 0.9 kWh
% error = 0.9 × 100/3.2 = 28.12 %
Example 10.39. The disc of an energy meter makes 600 revolutions per unit of energy. When a
1000 watt load is connected, the disc rotates at 10.2 r.p.s if the load is on for 12 hours, how many
units are recorded as error ? (Measurs, Instru. Allahabad Univ. 1992)
Solution. Since load power is one kWh, energy actually consumed is
= 1 × 12 = 12 kWh
Total number of revolutions made by the disc during the period of 12 hours
= 10.2 × 60 × 12 = 7,344
since 600 revolutions record one kWh, energy recorded by the meter is
= 7,344/600 = 12.24 kWh
Hence, 0.24 unit is recorded extra.
Example 10.40. A d.c. ampere-hour meter is rated at 5-A, 250-V. The declared constant is
5 A-s/rev. Express this constant in rev/kWh. Also calculate the full-load speed of the meter.
(Elect. Meas. Inst. and Meas., Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. Meter constant = 5 A-s/rev
Now, 1 kWh = 103 Wh = 103 × 3600 volt-second
= 36 × 105 volt × amp × secondElectrical Instruments and Measurements 427
Hence, on a 250-V circuit, this corresponds to 36 × 105/250 = 14,400 A-s
Since for every 5 A-s, there is one revolution, the number of revolution is one kWh is
= 14,400/5 = 2,880 revolutions
∴ Meter constant = 2,800 rev/kWh
Since full-load meter current is 5 A and its constant is 5 A-s/rev, it is obvious that it makes one
revolution every second.
∴ full load speed = 60 r.p.m.
Example 10.41. The declared constant of a 5-A, 200-V amp-hour meter is 5 coulomb per
revolution. Express the constant in rev/kWh and calculate the full-load speed of the meter.
In a rest at half load, the meter disc completed 60 revolutions in 119-5 seconds. Calculate the
meter error.
Solution. Meter constant = 5 C/rev, or 5 A-s/rev.
1 kWh 1000 Wh = 1000 × 3600 watt-second
= 1000 × 3600 volt × amp × second
Hence, on a 200-V circuit, this corresponds to
= 100 × 3600/200 = 18,000 A-s
Since for every 5 A-s, there is one revolution, hence number of revolution is one kWh = 18,000/
5 = 3600 revolution ∴ Meter constant = 3600 rev/kWh
Since full-load meter current is 5 A and its constant 5 A-s/rev, it is obvious that it makes one
revolution every one second.
∴ its full-load speed = 60 r.p.m.
At half-load
Quantity passed in 60 revolutions = 119.5 × 2.5 A-s or 298.75 C
Correct No. of revolutions = 298.75/5 = 69.75
Obviously the meter is running fast because instead of making 59.75 revolutions, it is making 60
revolutions.
Error = 60 − 59.75 = 0.25 ∴ % error = 0.25 × 100/59.75 = 0.418 %
Example 10.42. (a). A single-phase energy meter of the induction type is rated 230-V; 10-A, 50-
Hz and has a meter constant of 600 rev/kWh when correctly adjusted. If ‘quadrature’ adjustment is
slightly disturbed so that the lag is 85º, calculate the percentage error at full-load 0.8 p.f. lag.
(Measu & Instru. Nagpur Univ 1991)
Solution. As seen from Art. 10.50, the driving torque. T depends among other factors, on
d
sin α where α is the angle between the two alternating fluxes. ∴ T ∝ sin α
d
If the voltage flux-lagging adjustment is disturbed so that the phase angle between the voltage
flux and the voltage is less than 90º (instead of being exactly 90º) the error is introduced.
Now cos φ = 0.8, φ = cos −1 (0.8) = 36º52′
∴ α = 85º − 36º52′ = 48º8′ where it should be = 90 − 36º52′ = 53º8′
sin53º8 sin48º8
∴ error = 100 7%
sin53º8
Example 10.42 (b). A 50-A, 230-V energy meter is a full-load test makes 61 revolutions in
37 seconds if the normal speed of the disc is 520 revolutions/kWh, compute the percentage error.
[Nagpur University November 1999]
Solution. Unity power-factor is assumed.
Energy consumed, in kWh, in 37 seconds

Number of revolutions corresponding to this energy = 520 × 0.1182 = 61.464
The meter makes 61 revolutions

∴ % Error = ×100% = −−−−− 0.755 %

10.52.Ballistic Galvanometer
It is used principally for measuring small electric charges
such as those obtained in magnetic flux measurements. Con-
structionally, it is similar to a moving-coil galvanometer except
that (i) it has extremely small electromagnetic damping and (ii)
has long period of undamped oscillation (several seconds).
These conditions are necessary if the galvanometer is to mea-
sure electric charge. In fact, the moment of inertia of the coil is
made so large that whole of the charge passes through the gal-
vanometer before its coil has had time to move sufficiently. In
that case, the first swing of the coil is proportional to the charge
passing through the galvanometer. After this swing has been
observed, the oscillating coil may be rapidly brought to rest by Ballistic Galvanometer
using eddy-current damping.
As explained above, the coil moves after the charge to be measured has passed through it. Obvi-
ously, during the movement of the coil, there is no current flowing through it. Hence, the equation of
its motion is
J
d2φ
+D
dθ
+Cθ = 0
dt2 dt
where J is the moment of inertia, D is damping constant and C is restoring constant.
Since damping is extremely small, the approximate solution of the above equation is
0 = U −(D/2J)t sin (ω t + φ)
e 0
At the start of motion, where r = 0, θ = 0, hence φ = 0 ∴ θ = Ue −(D/2J)t sin ωt ...(i)
0
During the passage of charge, at any
instant, there will be a deflecting torque of
Gi acting on the coil. If t is the time taken by
the whole charge to pass through, the torque
impulse due to this charge is
∫t ∫t
Gidt.Now idt = Q
0 0
Hence, torque impulse = GQ. This must
be equal to the change of angular momen-
tum produced i.e., jα where α is the angular
velocity of the coil at the end of the impulse
period. Fig. 10.66
∴ GQ = Jα
or α = GQ/J
Differentiating Eq. (i) above, we get
( )
dθ = U e −(D/2J)′ ω t − D J e −(D/2J)r sinω t
dt 0 2 0
Since duration of the passage of charge is very small, at the end of the passage, t ≅ 0, so that from
above, dq/dt = Uω.

However, in practice, due to the presence of small amount of damping, the successive oscilla-
tions diminish exponentially (Fig. 10.66). Even the first swing θ is much less than θ . Hence, it

becomes necessary to obtain the value of θ from the observed value of first maximum swing θ .

As seen from Fig. 10.66, the successive peak value θ , θ , θ etc. are φ radian apart or φ/ω

10.53. Vibration Galvanometer
Such galvanometers are widely used as null-point detectors in a.c. bridges.
Construction
As shown in Fig. 10.67. (a), it consists of a moving coil suspended between poles of a strong
permanent magnet. The natural frequency of oscillation of the coil is very high, this being achieved
by the use of a large value of control constant and a moving system of very small inertia. The
suspension (which provides control) is either a phosphor-bronze strip or is a bifilar suspension in
which case the two suspension wires carry the coil and a small piece of mirror (or in some cases the
two suspension wires themselves from the coil.)
Fig. 10.67
As seen, W is the suspension, C is the moving coil and M the mirror on which as cast a beam of
light. From mirror M, this beam is deflected on to a scale. When alternating current is passed through
C, an alternating torque is applied to it so that the reflected spot of light on the scale is drawn out in
the form of a band of light. The length of this band of light is maximum if the natural frequency of
oscillation of C coincides with the the supply frequency due to resonance. The turning of C may be
done in the following two ways :
(i) by changing the length of suspension W. This is achieved by raising or lowering bridge
piece B against which the bifilar loop presses.
(ii) by adjusting tension in the suspension. This is achieved by turning the knurled knob A.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 431
By making the damping very small, the resonance curve of the galvanometer can be made sharply-
peaked [Fig. 10.67 (b)]. In that case, the instrument discriminates sharply against frequencies other
than its own natural frequency. In other words, its deflection becomes very small even when the
frequency of the applied current differs by a very small amount from its resonance frequency.

If the equation of the current passing through the galvanometer is i = I sin ω, then the equation

The complementary function of the solution represents the transient motion, which in the case of

θ = A sin (ωt − φ)
where A and φ are constant.
Now, dθ/dt = ωA cos (ωt − φ) and d2θ/dt2 = − ω2A sin (ω t − θ). Substituting these values in

10.54. The Vibrating-reed Frequency Meter
1. Working Principle
Fig. 10.68432 Electrical Technology
The meter depends for its indication on the mechanical resonance of thin flat steel reeds arranged
alongside and, close to, an electromagnet as shown in Fig. 10.68.
2. Construction
The electromagnet has a laminated armature and its winding, in series with a resistance, is con-
nected across a.c. supply whose frequency is required. In that respect, the external connection of this
meter is the same as that of a voltmeter.
The metallic reeds (about 4 mm wide and 0.5 mm
thick) are arranged in a row and are mounted side by
side on a common and slightly flexible base which
also carries the armature of the electromagnet. The
upper free ends of the reeds are bent over a right
angles so as to serves as flags or targets and enamelled
white for better visibility. The successive reeds are
not exactly similar, their natural frequencies of
vibration differing by 1 cycle. The reeds are arranged
2
in ascending order of natural frequency.
3. Working
When the electromagnet is connected across the
supply whose frequency is to be measured, its mag-
netism alternates with the same frequency. Hence
the electromagnet exerts attracting force on each reed
once every half cycle. All reeds tend to vibrate but
only that whose natural frequency is exactly double
the supply frequency vibrates with maximum ampli-
tude due to mechanical resonance [Fig. 10.69 (a)].
The supply frequency is read directly by noting the
Fig. 10.69
scale mark opposite the white painted flag which is
vibrating the most (f = 50 Hz). The vibrations of other reeds would be so small as to be almost
unobservable. For a frequency exactly midway between the natural frequencies of the two reeds (f =
49.75 Hz), both will vibrate with amplitudes which are equal but much less than when the supply
frequency exactly coincides with that of the reeds.
4. Range
Such meters have a small range usually from 47 to 53 Hz or from 57 to 63 Hz etc.
The frequency range of a given set of reeds may be doubled by polarising the electromagnets as
explained below. As seen from above description, each reeds is attracted twice per cycle of the
supply i.e., once every half-cycle and the reeds whose natural frequency is twice that of the current is
of the one which responds most. Suppose the electromagnet carries an additional winding carrying
direct current whose steady flux is equal in magnitude to the alternating flux of the a.c. winding. The
resultant flux would be zero in one half-cycle and double in the other half-cycle when the two fluxes
reinforce each other so that the reeds would receive one impulse per cycle. Obviously, a reed will
indicate the frequency of the supply if the electromagnet is polarised and half the supply frequency if
it is unpolarised. The polarisation may be achieved by using an extra d.c. winding on the electromag-
net or by using a permanent tangent which is then wound with an a.c. winding.
5. Advantages
One great advantage of this reed-type meter is that its indications are independent of the wave-
form of the applied voltage and of the magnitude of the voltage, except that the voltage should be
high enough to provide sufficient amplitude for reed vibration so as to make its readings reliable.
However, its limitations are :
(a) it cannot read closer than half the frequency difference between adjacent reeds.
(b) its error is dependent upon the accuracy with which reeds can be turned to a given frequency.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 433
10.55.Electrodynamic Frequency Meter
It is also referred to as moving-coil frequency meter and is a ratiometer type of instrument.
1. Working Principle
The working principle may be understood from Fig. 10.70 which shows two moving coils rigidly
fixed together with their planes at right angles to each other and mounted on the shaft or spindle
situated in the field of a permanent magnet. There is no
mechanical control torque acting on the two coils. If G
1
and G are displacement constants of the two coils and I
2 1
and I are the two currents, then their respective torques
2
are T = G I cos θ, T = G I sin θ. These torques act in
1 1 1 2 2 2
the opposite directions.
Obviously, T decreases with θ where as T increases
1 2
but an equilibrium position is possible for same angle θ

for which

2 2
By modifying the shape of pole faces and the angle between the planes of the two coils, the ratio
I /I is made proportional to angle θ instead of tan θ. In that case, for equilibrium θ ∝ I /I
1 2 1 2
2. Construction
The circuit connections are shown in Fig. 10.71. The two ratiometer coils X and Y are connected
across the supply lines through their respective bridge rectifiers. The direct current I through
1
Fig. 10.71
coil X represents the R.M.S. value of capacitor current I as rectified by B . Similarly, direct current
C 1
I flowing through Y is the rectified current I passing through series resistance R.
2 R
3. Working
When the meter is connected across supply lines, rectified currents I and I pass through coils X
1 2
and Y they come to rest at an angular position where their torques are equal but opposite. This
angular position is dependent on the supply frequency which is read by a pointer attached to the coil.
As proved above, θ ∝ I /I
1 2
Assuming sinusoidal waveform, mean values of I and I are proportional to the R.M.S. values of
1 2
I and I respectively.

Obviously, such meters have linear frequency scales. Moreover, since their readings are inde-
pendent of voltage, they can be used over a fairly wide range of voltage although at too low voltages,
the distortions introduced by rectifier prevent an accurate indication of frequency.
It will be seen that the range of frequency covered by the meter depends on the value of R and C
and these may be chosen to get ranges of 40–60 Hz, 1200–2000 Hz or 8000–12,000 Hz.
10.56. Moving-iron Frequency Meter
1. Working Principle
The action of this meter depends on the variation in current drawn by two parallel circuits – one
inductive and the other non-inductive—when the frequency changes.
2. Construction
The construction and internal connections are shown in Fig. 10.72.
The two coils A and B are so fixed that their magnetic axes are per-
pendicular to each other. At their centres is pivoted a long and thin
soft-iron needle which aligns itself along the resultant magnetic field
of the two coils. There is no control device used in the instrument.
It will be noted that the various circuit elements constitute a Wheat-
stone bridge which becomes balanced at the supply frequency. Coil A
has a resistance R in series with it and a reactance L in parallel.
A A
Similarly R is in series with coil B and L is in parallel. The series
B B
inductance L helps to suppress higher harmonics in the current wave-
form and hence, tends to minimize the waveform errors in the indica-
tion of the instrument.
3. Working
Fig. 10.72
On connecting the instrument across the supply, currents pass
through coils A and B and produce opposing torques. When supply frequency is high, currents through
coil A is more whereas that through coil B is less due to the increase in the reactance offered by L .
B
Hence, magnetic field of coil A is stronger than that of coil B. Consequently, the iron needle lies more
nearly to the magnetic axis of coil A than that of B. For low frequencies, coil B draws more current
than coil A and, hence, the needle lies more nearly parallel to the magnetic axis of B than to that of coil
A. The variations of frequency are followed by the needle as explained above.
The instrument can be designed to cover a broad or narrow range of frequencies determined by
the parameters of the circuit.
10.57.Electrodynamic Power Factor Meter
1. Working Principle
The instrument is based on the dynamometer prin-
ciple with spring control removed.
2. Construction
As shown in Fig. 10.73 and 10.74, the instrument
has a stationary coil which is divided into two sections
F and F . Being connected in series with the supply
1 2
line, it carries the load current. Obviously, the uniform
field produced by F and F is proportional to the line
1 2
current. In this field are situated two moving coils C
1
and C rigidly attached to each other and mounted on the
2
same shaft or spindle. The two moving coils are ‘volt-
Fig. 10.73
age’ coils but C has a series resistance R whereas C has
1 2Electrical Instruments and Measurements 435
a series inductance L. The values of R and L as well as turns on C and C are so adjusted that the
1 2
ampere-turns of C and C are exactly equal. However, I is in phase with the supply voltage V
1 2 1
whereas I lags behind V by nearly 90º. As mentioned earlier, there is no control torque acting on C
2 1
and C – the currents being led into them by fine ligaments which exerts no control torque.
2
3. Working
Consider the case when load power factor is unity i.e. I is in phase with V. Then I is in phase
1
withI whereas I lags behind by 90°. Consequently, a torque will act on C which will set its plane
2 1
perpendicular to the common magnetic axis of coils F and F i.e. corresponding to the pointer
1 2
position of unity p.f. However, there will be no torque acting on coil C .
2
Now, consider the case when load power factor is zero i.e. I lags behind V by 90° (like current I ).
2
In that case, I will be in phase with I where as I will be 90° out of phase. As a result, there will be
2 1
no toruqe on C but that acting on C will bring its plane perpendicular to the common magnetic axis
1 2
of F and F . For intermediate values of power factor, the deflection of the pointer corresponds to the
1 2
load power factor angle φ or to cos φ, if the instrument has been calibrated to read to power factor
direcly.
For reliable readings, the instrument has to be calibrated at the frequency of the supply on which
it is to be used. At any other frequency (or when harmonics are present), the reactance of L will
change so that the magnitude and phase of current through C will be incorrect and that will lead to
2
serious errors in the instrument readings.
Fig. 10.74 Fig. 10.75
For use on balanced 3-phase load, the instrument is modified, so as to have C and C at 120° to
1 2
each other, instead of 90°, as in 1-phase supply. As shown in Fig. 10.75, C and C are connected
1 2
across two different phase of the supply circuit, the stationary coils F and F being connected in
1 2
series with the third phase (so that it carries the line current). Since there is no need of phase splitting
between the currents of C and C , I and I are not determined by the phase-splitting circuit and
1 2 1 2
consequently, the instrument is not affected by variations in frequency or waveform.
10.58. Moving-iron Power Factor Meter
1. Construction
One type of power factor meter suitable for 3-phase balanced circuits is shown in Fig. 10.76. It
consists of three fixed coils R, Y and B with axes mutually at 120° and intersecting on the centre line
of the instrument. These coils are connected respectively in R, Y and B lines of the 3-phase supply
through current transformers. When so energised, the three coils produce a synchronously rotating
flux.436 Electrical Technology
There is a fixed coil B at the centre of three fixed coils and is connected in series with a high
resistance across one of the pair of lines, say, across R and Y lines as shown. Coil B is threaded by the
instrument spindle which carries an iron cylinder C [Fig. 10.76 (b)] to which are fixed sector-shaped
iron vanes V and V . The same spindle also carries damping vanes and pointer (not
1 2
shown in the figure) but there are no control springs. The moving system is shown separately in Fig.
10.76 (b).
2. Working
The alternating flux produced by coil B interacts with the fluxes produced by the three current
coils and causes the moving system to take up a position determined by the power factor angle of the
load. However, the instrument is calibrated to read the power factor cos φ directly instead of φ. In
other words, the angular deflection φ of the iron vanes from the line M N in Fig. 10.76 (a) is equal to
the phase angle φ.
Because of the rotating field produced by coils R, Y and B, there is a slight induction-motor
action which tends to continuously turn the moving iron in the direction of the rotating flux. Hence,
it becomes essential to design the moving iron as to make this torque negligibly small i.e. by using
high-resistance metal for the moving iron in order to reduce eddy currents in it.
Fig. 10.76
3. Merits and Demerits
Moving iron p.f. meters are more commonly used as compared to the electrodynamic type
because
(i) they are robust and comparatively cheap (ii) they have scales upto 360° and
(ii) in their case, all coils being fixed, there are no electrical connections to the moving parts.
On the other hand, they are not as accurate as the electrodynamic type of instruments and, more-
over, suffer from erros introduced by the hysteresis and eddy-current losses in the iron parts–these
losses varying with load and frequency.
10.59. Nalder-Lipman Moving-iron Power Factor Meter
1. Construction
The moving system of this instrument (Fig. 10.77) consists of three iron elements similar to the
one shown in Fig. 10.76 (b). They are all mounted on a common shaft, one above the other, and are
separated from one another by non-magnetic distance pieces D and D . The three pairs of sectors
1 2
are displaced in space by 120° relative to each other. Each iron vane is magnetised by one of the three
voltage coils B , B and B which are connected (in series with a high resistance R) in star across the
1 2 3
supply lines. The whole system is free to move in the space between two parallel halves F and F of
1 2
a single current coil connected in one line of the supply. The common spindle also carries the damping
vanes (not shown) and the pointer P.Electrical Instruments and Measurements 437
2. Working
The angular position of the moving system is determined by the phase angle φ between the line
current and the respective phase voltage. In other words, deflection θ is equal to φ, although, in
practice, the instrument is calibrated to read the power factor directly.
3. Advantages
(i) Since no rotating magnetic field is produced, there is no tendency for the moving system to
be dragged around continuously in one direction.
(ii) This instrument is not much affected by the type of variations of frequency, voltage and
waveform as might be expected in an ordinary supply.
Fig. 10.77
10.60. D.C. Potentiometer
A potentiometer is used for measuring and comparing
the e.m.fs. of different cells and for calibrating and stan-
dardizing voltmeters, ammeters etc. In its simplest from,
it consists of a Ger-
man silver or
manganin wire usu-
ally one meter long
and stretched be-
tween two termi-
nals as shown in
DC potentiometer Fig. 10.78.
This wire is connected in series with a suitable rheostat
and battery B which sends a steady current through the resis-
tance wire AC. As the wire is of uniform cross-section through-
Fig. 10.78
out, the fall in potential across it is uniform and the drop be-
tween any two points is proportional to the distance between them. As seen, the battery voltage is
spread over the rheostat and the resistance wire AC. As we go along AC, there is a progressive fall of
potential. If ρ is the resistance/cm of this wire, L its length, then for a current of I amperes, the fall of
potential over the whole length of the wire is ρ LI volts.438 Electrical Technology
The two cells whose e.m.fs are to be compared are joined as shown in Fig. 10.78, always remem-
bering that positive terminals of the cells and the battery must be joined together. The cells can be
joined with the galvanometer in turn through a two-way key. The other end of the galvanometer is
connected to a movable contact on AC. By this movable contact, a point like D is found when there
is no current in and hence no deflection of G. Then, it means that the e.m.f. of the cell just balances
the potential fall on AD due to the battery current passing through it.
Suppose that the balance or null point for first cell of e.m.f. E occurs at a length L as measured
1 1
from point A. The E = ρ L I.
1 1
Similarly, if the balance point is at L for th other cell, then E = ρ L I.
2 2 2
E ρLI L
Dividing one equation by the other, we have 1 = 1 = 1
E ρL I L
2 2 2
If one of the cells is a standard cell, the e.m.f. of the other cell can be found.
10.61.Direct-reading Potentiometer
The simple potentiometer described above is used
for educational purposes only. But in it commercial
form, it is so calibrated that the readings of the poten-
tiometer give the voltage directly, thereby eliminat-
ing tedious arithmetical calculations and so saving ap-
preciable time.
Such a direct-reading potentiometer is shown in
Fig. 10.79. The resistance R consists of 14 equal re-
sistances joined in series, the resistance of each unit
being equal to that of the whole slide were S (which
is divided into 100 equal parts). The battery current Fig. 10.79
is controlled by slide wire resistance W.
10.62. Standardizing the Potentiometer
A standard cell i.e. Weston cadmium cell of e.m.f. 1.0183 V is connected to sliding contacts P
and Q through a sensitive galvanometer G. First, P is put on stud No. 10 and Q on 18.3 division on
S and then W is adjusted for zero deflection on G. In that case, potential difference between P and Q
is equal to cell voltage i.e. 1.0183 V so that potential drop on each resistance of R is 1/10 = 0.1 V and
every division of S represents 0.1/100 = 0.001 V. After standardizing this way, the position of W is
not to be changed in any case otherwise the whole adjustment would go wrong. After this, the
instrument becomes direct reading. Suppose in a subsequent experiment, for balance, P is moved to
stud No. 7 and Q to 84 division, then voltage would be
= (7 × 0.1) + (84 × 0.001) = 0.784 V.
It should be noted that since most potentiometers
have fourteen steps on R, it is usually not possible to
measure p.ds. exceeding 1.5 V. For measuring higher
voltges, it is necessary to use a volt box.
10.63. Calibration of Ammeters
The ammeter to be calibrated is connected in series
with a variable resistance and a standard resistance F,
say, of 0.1 Ω across battery B of ample current capacity
1
as shown in Fig. 10.80. Obviously, the resistance of F
should be such that with maximum current flowing
through the ammeter A, the potential drop across F
should not exceed 1.5 V. Some convenient current, say Fig. 10.80Electrical Instruments and Measurements 439
6 amperes (as indicated by A) is passed through the circuit by adjusting the rheostat RH.
The potential drop across F is applied between P and Q as shown. Next the sliding contacts P
and Q are adjusted for zero deflection on G. Suppose P reads 5 and Q reads 86.7. Then it means that
p.d. across F is 0.5867 V and since F is of 0.1 Ω, hence true value of current through F is 0.5867/0.1
= 5.867 amperes. Hence, the ammeter reads high by (6 − 5.867) = 0.133A. The test is repeated for
various values of current over the entire ranges of the ammeter.
10.64.Calibration of Voltmeters
As pointed out in Art. 10.62, a voltage higher
than 1.5 cannot be measured by the potentiom-
eter directly, the limit being set by the standard
cell and the type of the potentiometer (since it has
only 14 resistances on R as in Fig. 10.79). How-
ever, with the help of a volt-box which is nothing
else but a voltage reducer, measurements of volt-
age up to 150 V or 300 V can be made, the upper
limit of voltage depending on the design of the
volt-box.
The diagram of connections for calibration
of voltmeters is shown in Fig. 10.81. By calibration
is meant the determination of the extent of error
in the reading of the voltmeter throughout its
range. A high value resistor AB is connected
across the supply terminals of high voltage battery
B so that it acts as a voltage divider. The volt-
1
box consists of a high resistance CD with tapings
at accurately determined points like E and F etc.
The resistance CD is usually 15,000 to 300 Ω.
The two tappings E and F are such that the
resistances of portions CE and CF are 1/100th and
1/10th the resistance CD. Obviously, whatever
the potential drop across CD, the corresponding
potential drop across CE is 1/100th and that across Fig. 10.81
CF, 1/10th of that across CD.
If supply voltage is 150 V, then p.d. across AB is also 150 V and if M coincides with B, then p.d.
across CD is also 150 V, so across CF is 15 volts and across CE is 1.5 V. Then p.d. across CE can be
balanced over the potentiometer as shown in Fig. 10.81. Various voltages can be applied across the
voltmeter by moving the contact point M on the resistance AB.
Suppose that M is so placed by voltmeter V reads 70 V and p.d. across CE is balanced by adjust-
ing P and Q. If the readings on P and Q to give balance are 7 and 8.4 respectively, then p.d. across CE
is 0.7084 V.
Hence, the true p.d. across AM or CD or voltmeter is 0.7048 × 100 = 70.84 V (because resistance
of CD is 100 times greater than that of CE). In other words, the reading of the voltmeter is low by
0.84 V.
By shifting the position of M and then balancing the p.d. across CE on the potentiometer, the
voltmeter can be calibrated throughout its range. By plotting the errors on a graph, a calibration
curve of the instrument can also be drawn.
10.65. A.C. Potentiometer
An A.C. potentiometer basically works on the same principle as a d.c. potentiometer. However,440 Electrical Technology
there is one very important difference between the two.
In d.c. potentiometer, only the magnitudes of the
unknown e.m.f. and slide-wire voltage drop are made
equal for obtaining balance. But in an a.c.
potentiometer, not only the magnitudes but phases as
well have to be equal for obtaining balance. Moreover,
to avoid frequency and waveform errors, the a.c.
supply for slide-wire must be taken from same source
as the voltage or current to be measured.
A.C. potentiometers are of two general types dif-
Fig. 10.82
fering in the manner in which the value of the un-
known voltage is presented by the instrument dials or scales. The two types are :
(i) Polar potentiometers in which the unknown voltage is mesured in polar form i.e. in terms of
magnitude and relative phase.
(ii) Co-ordinate potentiometers which measure the rectangular co-ordinates of the voltage under
test.
The two products are illustrated in Fig. 10.82. In Fig. 10.82 (a), vector OQ denotes the test
voltage whose magnitude and phase are to be imitated. In polar potentiometer, the length r of the
vector OP can be varied with the help of a sliding contact on the slidewire while its phase φ is varied
independently with the help of a phase-shifter. Drysdale potentiometer is of this type.
In co-ordinate type potentiometers, the unknown voltage vector OQ is copied by the adjustment
of ‘in phase’ and ‘quadrature’ components X and Y. Their values are read from two scales of the
potentiometer. The magnitude of the required vector is = X2 +Y2 and its phase is given by
φ = tan −1 (X/Y). Examples of this type are (i) Gall potentiometer and (ii) Campbell-Larsen potentiometer.
10.66. Drysdale Polar Potentiometer
As shown in Fig. 10.83 for a.c. measurements, the slide-wire MN is supplied from a phase shift-
ing circuit so arranged that magnitude of the voltage supplied by it remains constant while its
Fig. 10.83
phase can be varied through 360°. Consequently, slide-wire current I can be maintained constant in
magnitude but varied in phase. The phase-shifting circuit consists of :Electrical Instruments and Measurements 441
(i) Two stator coils supplied from the same source in parallel. Their currents I and I are made
1 2
to differ by 90° by using well-known phase-splitting technique.
(ii) The two windings produce a rotating flux which induces a secondary e.m.f. in the rotor
winding which is of constant magnitude but the phase of which can be varied by rotating the
rotor in any position either manually or otherwise. The phase of the rotor e.m.f. is read from
the circular graduated dial provided for the purpose.
The ammeter A in the slide-wire circuit is of electrodynamic of thermal type. Before using it for
a.c. measurements, the potentiometer is first calibrated by using d.c. supply for slidwire and a standard
cell for test terminals T and T .
1 2
The unknown alternating voltage to be measured is applied across test terminals I and T bal-
2 2
ance is effected by the alternate adjustment of the slide-wire contact and the position of phase-shift-
ing rotor. The slide-wire reading represents the magnitude of the test voltage phase-shifter reading
gives its phase with reference to an arbitrary reference vector.
10.67. Gall Co-ordinate Potentiometer
This potentiometer uses two slide-wires CD and MN with their currents I and I (Fig. 10.84)
1 2
having a mutual phase difference of 90°. The two currents are obtained from the single phase supply
through isolating transformers, the circuit for ‘quadrature’ slidewire MN incorporating a phase shift-
ing arrangement.
Fig. 10.84
Before use, then current I is first standardised as described for Drysdale potentiometer (Art.
1
10.66). Next, current I is standardised with the help of the mutually induced e.m.f. E in inductometer
2
secondary. This e.m.f. E = ω MI and is in quadrature phase with I . Now, E is balanced against the
1 1
voltage drop on slide-wire MN. This balance will be obtained only when I is of correct magnitude
2
and is in exact quadrature with I . Balance is achieved with the help of the phase-shifter and rheostat
1
R .
2
The unknown voltage is applied across the test terminals T and T . Slide-wire MN measures that
1 2
component of the unknown voltage which is in phase with I . Similarly, slide-wire CD measures that
2
component of the unknown voltage which is in phase with I . Since I and I are in quadrature, the
1 1 2442 Electrical Technology
two measured values are quadrature components of the unknown voltage. If V and V are these
1 2
values, then
V = V2 +V2 and φ = tan −1 (V /V ) —with respect to I
1 2 2 1 1
Reversing switches S and S are used for measuring both positive and negative in-phase and
1 2
quadrature components of the unknown-voltage.
10.68.Instrument Transformers
The d.c. circuits when large currents are to be measured, it is usual to use low-range ammeters
with suitable shunts. For measuring high voltages, low-range voltmeters are used with high resis-
tances connected in series with them. But it is neither convenient nor practical to use this method
with alternating current and voltage instruments. For this purpose, specially constructed accurate-
ratio instrument transformers are employed in conjunction with standard low-range a.c. instruments.
Their purpose is to reduce the line current or supply voltage to a value small enough to be easily
measured with meters of moderates size and capacity. In other words, they are used for extending the
range of a.c. ammeters and voltmeters. Instruments transformers are of two types :
(i) current transformers (CT) —for measuring large alternating currents.
(ii) potential transformers (VT) —for measuring high alternating voltages.
Advantages of using instrument transformers for range extension of a.c. meters are as follows :
(1) the instrument is insulated from the line voltage, hence it can be grounded. (2) the cost of the
instrument (or meter) together with the instrument transformer is less than that of the instrument alone
if it were to be insulated for high voltages. (3) it is possible to achieve standardisation of instruments
and meters at secondary ratings of 100–120 volts and 5 or 1 amperes (4) if necessary, several instru-
ments can be operated from a single transformer and 5 power consumed in the measuring circuits is
low.
In using instrument transformers for current (or voltage) measurements, we must know the ratio
of primary current (or voltage) to the secondary current (or voltage). These ratios give us the multi-
plying factor for finding the primary values from the instrument readings on the secondary side.
However, for energy or power measurements, it is essential to know not only the transformation
ratio but also the phase angle between the primary and secondary currents (or voltages) because it
necessitates further correction to the meter reading.
For range extension on a.c. circuits, instrument transformers are more desirable than shunts (for
current) and multipliers (for voltage measurements) for the following reasons :
1. time constant of the shunt must closely match the time constant of the instrument. Hence, a
different shunt is needed for each instrument.
2. range extension is limited by the current-carrying capacity of the shunt i.e. upto a few hun-
dred amperes at the most.
3. if current is at high voltage, instrument insulation becomes a very difficult problem.
4. use of multipliers above 1000 becomes almost impracticable.
5. insulation of multipliers against leakage current and reduction of their distributed capaci-
tance becomes not only more difficult but expensive above a few thousand volts.
10.69. Ratio and Phase-angle Errors
For satisfactory and accurate performance, it is necessary that the ratio of transformation of the
instrument transformer should be constant within close limits. However, in practice, it is found that
neither current transformation ratio I /I (in the case of current transformers) nor voltage transforma-
1 2
tion ratio V /V (in the case of potential transformers) remains constant. The transformation ratio is
1 2
found to depend on the exciting current as well as the current and the power factor of the secondary
circuit. This fact leads to an error called ratio error of the transformer which depends on the working
component of primary.
It is seen from Fig. 1.85 (a) that the phase angle between the primary and secondary currents is
not exactly 180° but slightly less than this value. This difference angle β may be found by reversingElectrical Instruments and Measurements 443
Fig. 10.85
vector I . The angular displacement between I and I reversed is called the phase angle error of the
2 1 2
current transformer. This angle is reckoned positive if the reversed secondary current leads the
primary current. However, on very low power factors, the phase angle may be negative. Similarly,
there is an angle of γ between the primary voltage V and secondary voltage reversed-this angle
1
represents the phase angle error of a voltage transformer. In either case, the phase error depends on
the magnetising component Iμ of the primary current. It may be noted that ratio error is primarily due
to the reason that the terminal voltage transformation ratio of a transformer is not exactly equal to its
turn ratio. The divergence between the two depends on the resistance and reactance of the trans-
former windings as well as upon the value of the exciting current of the transformer. Accuracy of
voltage ratio is of utmost importance in a voltage transformer although phase angle error does not
matter if it is to be merely connected to a voltmeter. Phase-angle error becomes important only when
voltage transformer supplies the voltage coil of a wattmeter i.e. in power measurement. In that case,
phase angle error causes the wattmeter to indicate on a wrong power factor.
In the case of current transformers, constancy of current ratio is of paramount importance. Again,
phase angle error is of no significance if the current transformer is merely feeding an ammeter but it
assumes importance when feeding the current coil of a wattmeter. While discussing errors, it is
worthwhile to define the following terms :
(i) Nominal transformation ratio (k ). It is the ratio of the rated primary to the rated second-
n
ary current (or voltage).
ratedprimarycurrent(I )
k = 1 —for CT
n ratedsecondarycurrent(I )
2
ratedprimaryvoltage(V)
= 1 —for VT
ratedsecondaryvoltage(V )
2
In the case of current transformers, it may be stated either as a fraction such as 500/5 or 100/1 or444 Electrical Technology
simply as the number representing the numerator of the reduced fraction i.e.100. It is also known as
marked ratio.
(ii) Actual transformation ratio (k). The actual transformation ratio or just ratio under any
given condition of loading is
primarycurrent(I )
k = 1
correspondingsecondarycurrent(I )
2
In general, k differs from k except in the case of an ideal or perfect transformer when k = k for
n n
all conditions of loading.
(iii) Ratio Error (σσσσσ). In most measurements it may be assumed that I = k I but for very accurate
1 n 2
work, it is necessary to correct for the difference between k and k . It can be done with the help of
n
ratio error which is defined as
k −k nominalratio-actualratio
σ = n =
k actualratio
k .I −kI k .I −I
Also, σ = n 2 2 = n 2 1
k.I I
2 1
Accordingly, ratio error may be defined as the difference between the primary current reading
(assuming the nominal ratio) and the true primary current divided by the true primary current.

10.70. Current Transformer
A current transformer takes the place of shunt in d.c. measurements and enables heavy alternat-
ing current to be measured with the help of a standard 5-A range
a.c. ammeter.
As shown in Fig. 10.86, the current - or series-transformer
has a primary winding of one or more turns of thick wire con-
nected in series with the line carrying the current to be mea-
sured. The secondary consist of a large number of turns of fine
wire and feeds a standard 5-A ammeter (Fig. 10.86) or the cur-
rent coil of a watt-meter or watthour-meter (Fig. 10.87).
For example, a 1,000/5A current transformer with in single-
Fig. 10.86 turn primary will have 200 secondary turns. Obviously, it steps
down the current in the 200 : 1 ratio whereas it steps up the
voltage drop across the single-turn primary (an extremely small quantity) in the ratio 1 : 200. Hence
if we know the current ratio of the transformer and the reading of the a.c. ammeter, the line current can
be calculated.
It is worth noting that ammeter resistance being extremely low, a current transformer operates
with its secondary under nearly short-circuit condi-
tions. Should it be necessasry to remove the amme-
ter of the current coils of the wattmeter or a relay, the
seondary winding must, first of all, be short-circuited
before the instrument is disconnected.
If it is not done then due to the absence of counter
ampere-turns of the secondary, the unopposed primary
m.m.f. will set up an abnormally high flux in the core
which will produce excessive core loss with
subsequent heating of and damage of the transformer
insulation and a high voltage across the secondary
Fig. 10.87Electrical Instruments and Measurements 445
terminals. This is not the case with the ordinary constant-potential transformers because their primary
current is determined by the load on their secondary whereas in a current transformer, primary current
is determined entirely by the load on the system and not by the load on its own secondary. Hence, the
secondary of a current transformer should never be left open under any circumstances.
10.71.Theory of Current Transformer
Fig. 10.85 (b) represents the general phase diagram for a current transformer. Current I has

been exaggerated for clarity.
(a) Ratio Error. For obtaining an expression for the ratio error, it will be assumed that the turn
ratio n (= secondary turns, N /primary turns N ) is made equal to the nominal current ratio i.e. n = k .
2 1 n
In other words, it will be assumed that I /I = n although actually n = I /I ′. As seen from Art. 10.63.

For most instrument transformers, the power factor of the secondary burden is nearly unity so
that δ is very small. Hence, very approximately.

10.72. Clip-on Type Current Transformer
It has a laminated core which is so arranged that it can be
opened out at a hinged section by merely pressing a trigger-
like projection (Fig. 10.88). When the core is thus opened, it
permits the admission of very heavy current-carrying bus-bars
or feeders whereupon the trigger is released and the core is
tightly closed by a spring. The current-carrying conductor of
feeder acts as a single-turn primary whereas the secondary is
connected across the standard ammeter conveniently mounted
Fig. 10.88
in the handle itself.
10.73. Potential Transformers
These transformers are extremely accurate-ratio
stepdown transformers and are used in conjunction with
standard low-range voltmeters (100-120 V) whose
deflection when divided
by transformation ratio,
gives the true voltage on
the primary or high-
voltage side. In general,
they are of the shell type Fig. 10.89
and do not differ much from the ordinary two-winding transformers except
that their power rating is extremely small. Sine their secondary windings
are required to operate instruments or relays or pilot lights, their ratings
are usually of 40 to 100W. For safety, the secondary is completely
Potential transformer insulated from the high voltage primary and is, in addition, grounded for
affording protection to the operator. Fig. 10.89 shows the connection of such a transformer.
10.74.Ratio and Phase-angle Errors
In the case of a potential transformer, we are interested in the ratio of the primary to the secondary
terminal voltage and in the phase angle γ between the primary and reversed secondary terminal voltage
V′.
2
The general theory of voltage transformer is the same as for the power transformers except that,
as the current in the secondary burden is very small, the total primary current I is not much greater
1
than I .
0
In the phasor diagram of Fig. 10.90, vectors AB, BC, CD and DE represent small voltage drops
due to resistances and reactances of the transformer winding (they have been exaggerated for the sake
of clarity). Since the drops as well as the phase angle γ are small, the top portion of diagram 10.90 (a)
can be drawn with negligible loss of accuracy as in Fig. 10.90 (b) where V ′ vector has been drawn
2
parallel to the vector for V .
1Electrical Instruments and Measurements 447
In these diagrams, V ′ is the secondary terminal voltage as referred to primary assuming transfor-
2
mation without voltage drops. All actual voltage drops have been referred to the primary. Vector AB
represents total resistive drop as referred to primary i.e. I ′ R . Similarly, BC represents total reac-
2 01
tive drop as referred to primary i.e. I ′ X .
2 01
In a voltage transformer, the relatively large no-load current produces appreciable resistive drops
which have been represented by vectors CD and DE respectively. Their values are I R and I X
0 1 0 1
respectively.
(a) Ratio Error
In the following theory, n would be taken to represent the ratio of primary turns to secondary
turns (Art. 10.69). Further, it would be assumed, as before, that n equals the nominal transformation
ratio i.e. n = k .
n
In other words, it would be assumed that V /V = n, although, actually, V /V ′ = n.

operating with a total secondary impedance of 0.4 + j 0.3 Ω. At rated load, the iron loss and
magnetising components of no-load primary current are 1.5 A and 6 A respectively. Calculate the
ratio error and phase angle at rated primary current if the secondary has (a) 1000 turns and (b) 990

secondary burden is an ammeter of resistance 1.2 Ω and resistance of 0.5 Ω and the secondary
winding has a resistance of 0.2 Ω and reactance of 0.3 Ω. The core requires the equivalent of 100 AT

11.1. Generation of Alternating Voltages and Currents
Alternating voltage may be generated by rotating a coil in a magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 11.1
(a) or by rotating a magnetic field within a stationary coil, as shown in Fig. 11.1 (b).
Fig. 11.1
The value of the voltage generated depends, in each case, upon the number of turns in the coil,
strength of the field and the speed at which the coil or magnetic field rotates. Alternating voltage may
be generated in either of the two ways shown above, but rotating-field method is the one which is
mostly used in practice.
11.2. Equations of the Alternating Voltages and Currents
Consider a rectangular coil, having N turns and rotating in a uniform magnetic field, with an
angular velocity of ω radian/second, as shown in Fig.
11.2. Let time be measured from the X-axis. Maximum
flux Φ is linked with the coil, when its plane coincides
m
with the X-axis. In time t seconds, this coil rotates through
an angle θ = ω t. In this deflected position, the compo-
nent of the flux which is perpendicular to the plane of
the coil, is Φ = Φ cos ω t. Hence, flux linkages of the
m
coil at any time are N Φ = N Φ cos ω t.
m
According to Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic In-
duction, the e.m.f. induced in the coil is given by the rate
of change of flux-linkages of the coil. Hence, the value
of the induced e.m.f. at this instant (i.e. when
θ = ω t) or the instantaneous value of the induced e.m.f.
is
Fig. 11.2
e = − d (N Φ)volt=−N. d (Φ cosωt)volt = − NΦ ω (− sin ωt) volt
dt dt m m
= ω N Φ sin ωt volt = ω N Φ sin θ volt ...(i)
m m
When the coil has turned through 90º i.e. when θ = 90º, then sin θ = 1, hence e has maximum value,
say E . Therefore, from Eq. (i) we get
m
E = ω N Φ = ω N B A = 2 π f N B A volt ...(ii)
m m m m
where B = maximum flux density in Wb/m2 ; A = area of the coil in m2
m
f = frequency of rotation of the coil in rev/second
Substituting this value of E in Eq. (i), we get e = E sin θ = E sin ω t ...(iii)
m m mA.C. Fundamentals 455
Similarly, the equation of induced alternating current is i = I sin ω t ...(iv)
m
provided the coil circuit has been closed through a resistive load.
Since ω = 2πf, where f is the frequency of rotation of the coil, the above equations of the voltage
and current can be written as
e = E sin 2 π f t = E sin

⎟t and i = I sin 2 π ft = I sin
⎛
⎜
2π⎞
⎟t
m m ⎝ T ⎠ m m ⎝ T ⎠
where T = time-period of the alternating voltage or current = 1/f
It is seen that the induced e.m.f. varies as sine function of the time angle ω t and when e.m.f. is
plotted against time, a curve similar to the one shown in Fig. 11.3 is obtained. This curve is known as
sine curve and the e.m.f. which varies in this manner is known as sinusoidal e.m.f. Such a sine curve
can be conveniently drawn, as shown in Fig. 11.4. A vector, equal in length to E is drawn. It rotates
m
in the counter-clockwise direction with a velocity of ω radian/second, making one revolution while
the generated e.m.f. makes two loops or one cycle. The projection of this vector on Y-axis gives the
instantaneous value e of the induced e.m.f. i.e. E sin ω t.
m
Fig. 11.3 Fig. 11.4
To construct the curve, lay off along X-axis equal angular distance oa, ab, bc, cd etc. correspond-
ing to suitable angular displacement of the rotating vector. Now, erect coordinates at the points a, b,
c and d etc. (Fig. 11.4) and then project the free ends of the vector E at the corresponding positions
m
a′, b′ , c′ , etc to meet these ordinates. Next draw a curve passing through these intersecting points.
The curve so obtained is the graphic representation of equation (iii) above.
11.3. Alternate Method for the Equations of Alternating Voltages and Currents
In Fig. 11.5 is shown a rectangular coil AC having N turns
and rotating in a magnetic field of flux density B
Wb./m2. Let the length of each of its sides A and C be l meters
and their peripheral velocity v metre/second. Let angle be
measured from the horizontal position i.e. from the X-axis.
When in horizontal position, the two sides A and C move
parallel to the lines of the magnetic flux. Hence, no flux is cut
and so no e.m.f. is generated in the coil.
When the coil has turned through angle θ, its velocity
can be resolved into two mutually perpendicular components
(i) v cos θ component-parallel to the direction of the magnetic
flux and (ii) v sin θ component-perpendicular to the direction
Fig. 11.5
of the magnetic flux. The e.m.f. is generated due entirely to
the perpendicular component i.e. v sin θ.
Hence, the e.m.f. generated in one side of the coil which contains N conductors, as seen from Art.
7.7, is given by, e = N × Bl v sin θ.456 Electrical Technology
Total e.m.f. generated in both sides of the coil is
e = 2BNl v sin θ volt ...(i)
Now, e has maximum value of E (say) when θ = 90º. Hence, from Eq. (i) above, we get,
m
E = 2 B N l v volt. Therefore Eq. (i) can be rewritten as e = E sin θ ...as before
m m
If b = width of the coil in meters ; f = frequency of rotation of coil in Hz, then v = π bf
∴ E = 2 B N l × π b f = 2 π f N B A volts ...as before
m
Example 11.1. A square coil of 10 cm side and 100 turns is
rotated at a uniform speed of 1000 revolutions per minute, about
an axis at right angles to a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 Wb/m2.
Calculate the instantaneous value of the induced electromotive
force, when the plane of the coil is (i) at right angles to the field
(ii) in the plane of the field.
(Electromagnetic Theory, A.M.I.E. Sec B, 1992)
Solution. Let the magnetic field lie in the vertical plane and
the coil in the horizontal plane. Also, let the angle θ be measured
from X-axis.

(i) In this case, θ = 0º
∴ e = 0
(ii) Here θ = 90º, ∴ e = E sin 90º = E
m m
Substituting the given values, we get
e = 2π × (50/3) × 100 × 0.5 × 10 −2 = 52.3 V
11.4. Simple Waveforms
The shape of the curve obtained by plotting the instantaneous values of voltage or current as the
ordinate against time as a abscissa is called its waveform or wave-shape.
Fig. 11.6
An alternating voltage or current may not always take the form of a systematical or smooth wave
such as that shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, Fig. 11.6 also represents alternating waves. But while it is
scarcely possible for the manufacturers to produce sine-wave generators or alternators, yet sine wave
is the ideal form sought by the designers and is the accepted standard. The waves deviating from the
standard sine wave are termed as distorted waves.
In general, however, an alternating current or voltage is one the circuit direction of which
reverses at regularly recurring intervals.A.C. Fundamentals 457
11.5. Complex Waveforms
Complex waves are those which depart from the ideal sinusoidal form of Fig. 11.4. All alternating
complex waves, which are periodic and have equal positive and negative half cycles can be shown to
be made up of a number of pure sine waves, having different frequencies but all these frequencies are
integral multiples of that of the lowest alternating wave, called the fundamental (or first
harmonic). These waves of higher frequencies are called harmonics. If the fundamental frequency
is 50 Hz, then the frequency of the second harmonic is 100 Hz and of the third is 150 Hz and so on.
The complex wave may be composed of the fundamental wave (or first harmonic) and any number of
other harmonics.
In Fig. 11.7 is shown a complex wave which is made up of a fundamental sine wave of frequency
of 50 Hz and third harmonic of frequency of 150 Hz. It is seen that
Fig. 11.7 Fig. 11.8
(i) the two halves of the complex wave are identical in shape. In other words, there is no
distortion. This is always the case when only odd harmonic (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th etc.) are present.
(ii) frequency of the complex wave is 50 Hz i.e. the same as that of the fundamental sine wave.
In Fig. 11.8 is shown a complex wave which is a combination of fundamental sine wave of
frequency 50 Hz and 2nd harmonic of frequency
100 Hz and 3rd harmonic of frequency 150 Hz. It is
seen that although the frequency of the complex
wave even now remains 50 Hz, yet :
(i) the two halves of the complex wave are
not identical. It is always so when even harmonics
(2nd, 4th, 6th etc.) are present.
(ii) there is distortion and greater departure of
the wave shape from the purely sinusoidal shape.
Sometimes, a combination of an alternating and
direct current flows simultaneously through a cir-
cuit In Fig. 11.9 is shown a complex wave (con-
Fig. 11.9
taining fundamental and third harmonic) combined
with a direct current of value I . It is seen that the resultant wave remains undistorted in shape but is
D
raised above the axis by an amount I . It is worth noting that with reference to the original axis, the
D
two halves of the combined wave are not equal in area.
11.6. Cycle
One complete set of positive and negative values of alternating quantity is known as cycle. Hence,
each diagram of Fig. 11.6 represents one complete cycle.458 Electrical Technology
A cycle may also be sometimes specified in terms of angular measure. In that case, one complete
cycle is said to spread over 360º or 2π radians.
11.7. Time Period
The time taken by an alternating quantity to complete one cycle is called its time period T. For
example, a 50-Hz alternating current has a time period of 1/50 second.
11.8. Frequency
The number of cycles/second is called the frequency of the alternating quantity. Its unit is hertz
(Hz).
In the simple 2-pole alternator of Fig. 24.1 (b), one cycle of alternating current is generated in
one revolution of the rotating field. However, if there were 4 poles, then two cycles would have been
produced in each revolution. In fact, the frequency of the alternating voltage produced is a function
of the speed and the number of poles of the generator. The relation connecting the above three
quantities is given as
f = PN/120 where N = revolutions in r.p.m. and P = number of poles
For example, an alternator having 20 poles and running at 300 r.p.m. will generate alternating
voltage and current whose frequency is 20 × 300/120 = 50 hertz (Hz).
It may be noted that the frequency is given by the reciprocal of the time period of the alternating
quantity.
∴ f = 1/T or T = 1/f
11.9. Amplitude
The maximum value, positive or negative, of an alternating quantity is known as its amplitude.
11.10. Different Forms of E.M.F. Equation
The standard form of an alternating voltage, as already given in Art. 11.2, is
e = E sin θ = E sin ω t = E sin 2 π f t = E sin
2π
t
m m m m T
By closely looking at the above equations, we find that
(i) the maximum value or peak value or amplitude of an alternating voltage is given by the
coefficient of the sine of the time angle.
(ii) the frequency f is given by the coefficient of time divided by 2πππππ..
For example, if the equation of an alternating voltage is given by e = 50 sin 314t then its maxi-
mum value of 50 V and its frequency is f = 314/2π = 50 Hz.
Similarly, if the equation is of the form e = I (R2 +4ω2L2) sin 2 ω t, then its maximum value
m
is E = I (R2 +4ω2L2) and the frequency is 2ω/2π or ω/π Hz.
m m
Example 11.2. The maximum values of the alternating voltage and current are 400 V and 20 A
respectively in a circuit connected to 50 Hz supply and these quantities are sinusoidal. The instan-
taneous values of the voltage and current are 283 V and 10 A respectively at t = 0 both increasing
positively.
(i) Write down the expression for voltage and current at time t.
(ii) Determine the power consumed in the circuit. (Elect. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. (i) In general, the expression for an a.c. voltage is v = V sin (ω t + φ) where φ is the
m
phase difference with respect to the point where t = 0.A.C. Fundamentals 459
Now, v = 283 V ; V = 400 V. Substituting
m
t = 0 in the above equation, we get
283 = 400 (sin ω × 0 + φ) ∴ sin φ = 283/400
= 0.707 ; ∴ φ = 45º or π/4 radian.
Hence, general expression for voltage is
v = 400 (sin 2π × 50 × t + π/4)
= 400 sin (100 π t + π/4)
Similarly, at t = 0, 10 = 20 sin (ω × 0 + φ)
∴ sin φ = 0.5 ∴ φ = 30º or π/6 radian
Hence, the general expression for the current is
i = 20 (sin 100 π t + 30º) = 20 sin (100 π t + π/6) Fig. 11.10
(ii) P = VI cos θ where V and I are rms values and θ is the phase difference between the voltage
and current.
Now, V = V / 2 =400/ 2;I =20/ 2 ; θ = 45º − 30º = 15º (See Fig. 11.10)
m
∴ P = (400/ 2)×(20/ 2) × cos 15º = 3864 W
Example 11.3. An alternating current of frequency 60 Hz has a maximum value of 120 A. Write
down the equation for its instantaneous value. Reckoning time from the instant the current is zero
and is becoming positive, find (a) the instantaneous value after 1/360 second and (b) the time taken
to reach 96 A for the first time.
Solution. The instantaneous current equation is
i = 120 sin 2 π ft = 120 sin 120 π t
Now when t = 1/360 second, then
(a) i = 120 sin (120 × π × 1/360) ...angle in radians
= 120 sin (120 × 180 × 1/360) ...angle in degree
= 120 sin 60º = 103.9 A
(b) 96 = 120 × sin 2 × 180 × 60 × t ...angle in degree
or sin (360 × 60 × t) = 96/120 = 0.8 ∴ 360 × 60 × t = sin −1 0.8 = 53º (approx)
∴ t = θ/2πf = 53/360 × 60 = 0.00245 second.
11.11. Phase
By phase of an alternating current is meant the fraction of the time period of that alternating
current which has elapsed since the current last passed through the zero position of reference. For
example, the phase of current at point A is T/4 second, where T is time period or expressed in terms of
angle, it is π/2 radians (Fig. 11.11). Similarly, the phase of the rotating coil at the instant shown in
Fig. 11.1 is ω t which is, therefore, called its phase angle.
Fig. 11.11 Fig. 11.12460 Electrical Technology
In electrical engineering, we are, however, more concerned with relative phases or phase
differences between different alternating quantities, rather than with their absolute phases. Consider
two single-turn coils of different sizes [Fig. 11.12 (a)] arranged radially in the same plane and rotating
with the same angular velocity in a common magnetic field of uniform intensity. The e.m.fs. induced
in both coils will be of the same frequency and of sinusoidal shape, although the values of instantaneous
e.m.fs. induced would be different. However, the two alternating e.m.fs. would reach their maximum
and zero values at the same time as shown in Fig. 11.12 (b). Such alternating voltages (or currents) are
said to be in phase with each other. The two voltages will have the equations
e = E sin ω t and e = E sin ω t
1 m1 2 m2
11.12. Phase Difference
Now, consider three similar single-turn coils displaced from each other by angles α and β and
rotating in a uniform magnetic field with the same angular velocity [Fig. 11.13 (a)].
Fig. 11.13
In this case, the value of induced e.m.fs. in the three coils are the same, but there is one important
difference. The e.m.fs. in these coils do not reach their maximum or zero values simultaneously but
one after another. The three sinusoidal waves are shown in Fig. 11.13 (b). It is seen that curves B and
C are displaced from curve A and angles β and (α + β) respectively. Hence, it means that phase
difference between A and B is β and between B and C is α but between A and C is (α + β). The
statement, however, does not give indication as to which e.m.f. reaches its maximum value first. This
deficiency is supplied by using the terms ‘lag’ or ‘lead’.
A leading alternating quantity is one
which reaches its maximum (or zero) value
earlier as compared to the other quantity.
Similarly, a lagging alternating quantity
is one which reaches its maximum or zero
value later than the other quantity. For ex-
ample, in Fig. 11.13 (b), B lags behind A by
β and C lags behind A by (α + β) because
they reach their maximum values later.
The three equations for the instanta-
neous induced e.m.fs. are (Fig. 11.14)
e = E sin ω t ...reference quantity Fig. 11.14
A m
e = E sin (ωt − β)
B m
e = E sin [ωt − (α + β)]
C mA.C. Fundamentals 461
In Fig. 11.14, quantity B leads A by an angle φ. Hence, their equations are
e = E sin ω t ...reference quantity
A m
e = E sin (ωt − φ)
B m
A plus (+) sign when used in connection with phase difference denotes ‘lead’ whereas a minus (–)
sign denotes ‘lag’.
11.13. Root-Mean-Square (R.M.S.) Value
The r.m.s. value of an alternating current is given by that steady (d.c.) current which when
flowing through a given circuit for a given time produces the same heat as produced by the alter-
nating current when flowing through the same circuit for the same time.
It is also known as the effective or virtual value of the alternating current, the former term being
used more extensively. For computing the r.m.s. value of symmetrical sinusoidal alternating currents,
either mid-ordinate method or
analytical method may be used,
although for symmetrical but non-
sinusoidal waves, the mid-
ordinate method would be found
more convenient.
A simple experimental
arrangement for measuring the
equivalent d.c. value of a
Fig. 11.15
sinusoidal current is shown in Fig.
11.15. The two circuits have
identical resistances but one is connected to battery and the other to a sinusoidal generator. Wattmeters
are used to measure heat power in each circuit. The voltage applied to each circuit is so adjusted that
heat power production in each circuit is the same. In that case, the direct current will equal I / 2 which
m
is called r.m.s. value of the sinusoidal current.
11.14. Mid-ordinate Method
In Fig. 11.16 are shown the positive half cycles for both symmetrical sinusoidal and non-sinusoi-
dal alternating currents. Divide time base ‘t’ into n equal intervals of time each of duration t/n
seconds. Let the average values of instantaneous currents during these intervals be respectively i , i ,

Now, suppose that a direct current of value I produces the same heat through the same resistance

Hence, we find that for a symmetrical sinusoidal current

The r.m.s. value of an alternating current is of considerable importance in practice, because the
ammeters and voltmeters record the r.m.s. value of alternating current and voltage respectively. InA.C. Fundamentals 463
electrical engineering work, unless indicated otherwise, the values of the given current and voltage
are always the r.m.s. values.
It should be noted that the average heating effect produced during one cycle is

11.16. R.M.S. Value of a Complex Wave
In their case also, either the mid-ordinate method (when equation of the wave is not known) or
analytical method (when equation of the wave is known) may be used. Suppose a current having the
equation i = 12 sin ωt + 6 sin (3ωt − π/6) + 4 sin (5ωt + π/3) flows through a resistor of R ohm. Then,
in the time period T second of the wave, the effect due to each component is as follows :
Fundamental ............... (12/ 2)2 RT watt
3rd harmonic ............... (6/ 2)2 RT watt
5th harmonic ............... (4/ 2)2 RT watt
∴ Total heating effect = RT[(12/ 2)2 +(6/ 2)2 +(4/ 2)2]
If I is the r.m.s. value of the complex wave, then equivalent heating effect is I2RT
∴ I2RT = RT[(12/ 2)2 +(6/ 2)2 +(4/ 2)2]
∴ I = [(12/ 2)2 +(6/ 2)2 +(4/ 2)2] = 9.74 A
Had there been a direct current of (say) 5 amperes flowing in the circuit also*, then the r.m.s.
value would have been
= (12/ 2)2 (6/ 2)2 (4/ 2)2 52 = 10.93 A
Hence, for complex waves the rule is as follows : The r.m.s. value of a complex current wave is
equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the r.m.s. values of its individual components.
11.17. Average Value
The average value I of an alternating current is expressed by that steady current which transfers
a
across any circuit the same charge as is transferred by that alternating current during the same
time.
In the case of a symmetrical alternating current (i.e. one whose two half-cycles are exactly simi-
lar, whether sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal), the average value over a complete cycle is zero. Hence, in
their case, the average value is obtained by adding or integrating the instantaneous values of current
over one half-cycle only. But in the case of an unsymmetrical alternating current (like half-wave
rectified current) the average value must always be taken over the whole cycle.

Note. R.M.S. value is always greater than average value except in the case of a rectangular wave when
both are equal.
11.18. Form Factor
It is defined as the ratio, K = r.m.s. value = 0.707I m = 1.1. (for sinusoidal alternating currents only)
f average value 0.637I
m
0.707E
In the case of sinusoidal alternating voltage also, K = m = 1.11
f 0.637E
m
As is clear, the knowledge of form factor will enable the r.m.s. value to be found from the arith-
metic mean value and vice-versa.

For sinusoidal alternating voltage also, K = m = 1.414

Knowledge of this factor is of importance in dielectric insulation testing, because the dielectric
stress to which the insulation is subjected, is proportional to the maximum or peak value of the
applied voltage. The knowledge is also necessary when measuring iron losses, because the iron loss
depends on the value of maximum flux.
Example 11.4. An alternating current varying sinusoidally with a frequency of 50 Hz has an
RMS value of 20 A. Write down the equation for the instantaneous value and find this value
(a) 0.0025 second (b) 0.0125 second after passing through a positive maximum value. At what time,
measured from a positive maximum value, will the instantaneous current be 14.14 A ?
(Elect. Science-I Allahabad Univ. 1992)
Solution. I = 20 2 = 28.2 A, ω = 2π × 50 = 100 π rad/s.
m
The equation of the sinusoidal current wave with reference to point O (Fig. 11.17) as zero time
point is i = 28.2 sin 100 πππππt ampere
Since time values are given from point A
where voltage has positive and maximum value,
the equation may itself be referred to point A. In
the case, the equation becomes :
i = 28.2 cos 100 πt
(i) When t = 0.0025 second
i = 28.2 cos 100π × 0.0025
...angle in radian
= 28.2 cos 100 × 180 × 0.0025
...angle in degrees
= 28.2 cos 45º = 20 A ...point B
Fig. 11.17A.C. Fundamentals 465
(ii) When t = 0.0125 second
i = 28.2 cos 100 × 180 × 0.0125
= 28.2 cos 225º = 28.2 × (−1/ 2)
= −20 A ...point C
(iii) Here i = 14.14 A
1
∴ 14.14 = 28.2 cos 100 × 180 t ∴ cos 100 × 180 t =
2
or 100 × 180 t = cos −1 (0.5) = 60º, t = 1/300 second ...point D
Example 11.5. An alternating current of frequency 50 Hz has a maximum value of 100 A.
Calculate (a) its value 1/600 second after the instant the current is zero and its value decreasing
thereafter (b) how many seconds after the instant the current is zero (increasing thereafter wards)
will the current attain the value of 86.6 A ? (Elect. Technology. Allahabad Univ. 1991)
Solution. The equation of the alternating cur-
rent (assumed sinusoidal) with respect to the origin
O (Fig. 11.18) is
i = 100 sin 2π × 50t = 100 sin 100 πt
(a) It should be noted that, in this case, time is
being measured from point A (where current is zero
and decreasing thereafter) and not from point O.
If the above equation is to be utilized, then, this
time must be referred to point O. For this purpose,
half time-period i.e. 1/100 second has to be added to
1/600 second. The given time as referred to point O
Fig. 11.18
becomes
1 + 1 = 7
= second
100 600 600
∴ i = 100 sin 100 × 180 × 7/600 = 100 sin 210º
= 100 × − 1/2 = −−−−− 50 A ...point B
(b) In this case, the reference point is O.
∴ 86.6 = 100 sin 100 × 180 t or sin 18,000 t = 0.866
or 18,000 t = sin −1 (0.866) = 60º ∴ t = 60/18,000 = 1/300 second
Example 11.6. Calculate the r.m.s. value,
the form factor and peak factor of a periodic
voltage having the following values for equal
time intervals changing suddenly from one value
to the next : 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 60, 50, 20, 10, 5, 0,
−5, −10 V etc. What would be the r.m.s value of
sine wave having the same peak value ?
Solution. The waveform of the alternating
voltage is shown in Fig. 11.19. Obviously, it is
not sinusoidal but it is symmetrical. Hence,
though r.m.s value may be full one cycle, the
average value has necessarily to be considered
for half-cycle only, otherwise the symmetrical
negative and positive half-cycles will cancel each

Alternative Solution
If ‘t’ be the regular time interval, then area of the half-cycle is
= (5t + 10t + 20t + 50t) 2 + 60t = 230t, Base = 10t ∴Mean value = 230t/10t = 23 V.
Area when ordinates are squared = (25t + 100t + 400t + 2500t) 2 + 3600t = 9650t, Base = 10t
∴ Mean height of the squared curve = 9650t/10 t = 965
∴ r.m.s. value = 965 = 31 V
Further solution is as before.

nected across the terminals of a generator whose voltage waveform is represented by

the given voltage. Considering one complete cycle,

The r.m.s. value of individual components are (200/ 2), (100/ 2) and (50/ 2 ). Hence, as
stated in Art. 11.16,
V = V2 +V2+V2 = (200/ 2)2+(100/ 2)2+(50/ 2)2 = 162 V

11.20. R.M.S. Value of H.W. Rectified Alternating Current
Half-wave (H.W.) rectified alternating current is one whose one half-cycle has been suppressed
i.e. one which flows for half the time during one cycle. It is shown in Fig. 11.20 where suppressed
half-cycle is shown dotted.A.C. Fundamentals 467
As said earlier, for finding r.m.s. value of such an al-
ternating current, summation would be carried over the
period for which current actually flows i.e. from 0 to π,
though it would be averaged for the whole cycle i.e. from 0
to 2π.

(b) The reading of hot-wire ammeter is proportional to the average heating effect over the whole
cycle. It should further be noted that in a.c. circuits, the given voltage and current values, unless
indicated otherwise, always refer to r.m.s values.
E = 110/0.707 = 155.5 V (approx.) ; I /2 = 155.5/25 = 6.22 A
m m
Average value of current for positive half cycle = 0.637 × 6.22 = 3.96 A
Value of current in the negative half cycle is zero. But, as said earlier, due to inertia of the coil,
M.C. ammeter reads the average value for the whole cycle.
(i) M.C. ammeter reading = 3.96/2 = 1.98 A
Let R be the resistance of hot-wire ammeter. Average heating effect over the positive half cycle
is 1I2. R watts. But as there is no generation of heat in the negative half cycle, the average heating
2 m
effect over the whole cycle is 1I2R watt.
4 m
Let I be the d.c. current which produces the same heating effect, then
I2R = 1 I2 R ∴ I = I /2 = 6.22/2 = 3.11 A.
4 m m
Hence, hot-wire ammeter will read 3.11 A
(ii) Form factor = r.m.s value = 3.11 = 1.57 ; Peak factor = max. value = 6.22 = 2

Example 11.17. A half-wave rectifier which prevents current flowing in one direction is con-
nected in series with an a.c. ammeter and a permanent-magnet moving-coil ammeter. The supply is
sinusoidal. The reading on the a.c. ammeter is 10 A. Find the reading given by the other ammeter.
What should be the readings on the ammeters, if the other half-wave were rectified instead of being
cut off ?
Solution. It should be noted that an a.c. ammeter reads r.m.s. value whereas the d.c. ammeter
reads the average value of the rectified current.
As shown in Art. 11.20 from H.W. rectified alternating current, I = I /2 and I = I /π

As a.c. ammeter reads 10 A, hence r.m.s. value of the current is 10 A.

Solution. The required values can be found by using either graphical method or analytical

Graphical Method
The average value can be found by averaging the function from t = 0 to t = 1 in parts as given
below :
Average value of (f) = 1 ∫T f (t) dt = 1 × (net area over one cycle)
T 0 T
Now, area of a right-angled triangle = (1/2) × (base) × (altitude).
Hence, area of the triangle during t = 0 to t = 0.5 second is
A =

Similarly, area of the triangle from t = 0.5 to t = 1 second is

Net area from t = 0 to t = 1.0 second is A + A = −1+1 =0

Hence, average value of f (t) over one cycle is zero.

Example 11.24. A circuit offers a resistance of 20 Ω in one direction and 100 Ω in the reverse

(c) a moving-coil instrument with a full-wave rectifier (d) a moving-coil ammeter.
Calculate the reading of each instrument.
Solution. (a) The deflecting torque of an MI instrument is proportional to (current)2. Hence, its
reading will be proportional to the average value of i2 over the whole cycle. Therefore, the reading of

(b) An MC ammeter reads the average current over the whole cycle.
Average current over positive half-cycle is = 10 × 0.637 = 6.37 A
Average current over positive half-cycle is = − 2 × 0.637 = − 1.27 A
∴ Average value over the whole cycle is = (6.37 − 1.27)/2 = 2.55 A
(c) In this case, due to the full-wave rectifier, the current passing through the operating coil of
the instrument would flow in the positive direction during both the positive and negative half cycles.
∴ reading = (6.37 + 1.27)/2 = 3.82 A

Example 11.25. A moving coil ammeter, a hot-wire ammeter and a resistance of 100 Ω are
connected in series with a rectifying device across a sinusoidal alternating supply of 200 V. If the
device has a resistance of 100 Ω to the current in one direction and 5.00 Ω to current in opposite
direction, calculate the readings of the two ammeters.
(Elect. Theory and Meas. Madras University)
Solution. R.M.S. current in one direction is = 200/(100 + 100) = 1 A
Average current in the first i.e. positive half cycle is = 1/1.11 = 0.9 A
Similarly, r.m.s. value in the negative half-cycle is = − 200/(100 + 500) = − 1/3 A
Average value = (−1/3)/1.11 = −0.3 A
Average value over the whole cycle is = (0.9 − 0.3)/2 = 0.3 A
Hence, M/C ammeter reads 0.3 A
Average heating effect during the +ve half cycle = I2 × R = I2 × R = R
rms
Similarly, average heating effect during the −ve half-cycle is = (−1/3)2 × R = R/9
Here, R is the resistance of the hot-wire ammeter.
( )
Average heating effect over the whole cycle is = 1 R+ R = 5R
2 9 9
If I is the direct current which produces the same heating effect, then
I2 R = 5R/9 ∴I = 5/3 = 0.745 A
Hence, hot-wire ammeter indicates 0.745 A

(ii) Obviously, the instantaneous value of the resultant cur-
rent is given by i = (5 + 5 sin ωt) = (5 + 5 sin θ)

11.23. Representation of Alternating Quantities
It has already been pointed out that an attempt is made to obtain alternating voltages and currents
having sine waveform. In any case, a.c. computations are based on the assumption of sinusoidal
voltages and currents. It is, how-
ever, cumbersome to continu-
ously handle the instantaneous
values in the form of equations
of waves like e = E sin ωt etc.
m
A conventional method is to em-
ploy vector method of represent-
ing these sine waves. These vec-
tors may then be manipulated in-
stead of the sine functions to
achieve the desired result. In
fact, vectors are a shorthand for Fig. 11.40
the represen-tation of alternat-
ing voltages and currents and their use greatly simplifies the problems in a.c. work.
A vector is a physical quantity which has magnitude as well as direction. Such vector quantities
are completely known when particulars of their magnitude, direction and the sense in which they act,
are given. They are graphically represented by straight lines called vectors. The length of the line
represents the magnitude of the alternating quantity, the inclination of the line with respect to some
axis of reference gives the direction of that quantity and an arrow-head placed at one end indicates the
direction in which that quantity acts.A.C. Fundamentals 479
The alternating voltages and currents are represented by such vectors rotating counter-clockwise
with the same frequency as that of the alternating quantity. In Fig. 11.40 (a), OP is such a vector
which represents the maximum value of the alternating current and its angle with X axis gives its
phase. Let the alternating current be represented by the equation e = E sin ωt. It will be seen that the
m
projection of OP and Y-axis at any instant gives the instantaneous value of that alternating current.
∴ OM = OP sin ωt or e = OP sin ωt = E sin ωt
m
It should be noted that a line like OP can be made to represent an alternating voltage of current
if it satisfies the following conditions :
(i) Its length should be equal to the peak or maximum value of the sinusoidal alternating current
to a suitable scale. (ii) It should be in the horizontal position at the same instant as the alternating
quantity is zero and increasing. (iii) Its angular velocity should be such that it completes one revolu-
tion in the same time as taken by the alternating quantity to complete one cycle.
11.24.Vector Diagram using R.M.S. Values
Instead of using maximum values as above, it is very common practice to draw vector diagrams
using r.m.s. values of alternating quantities. But it should be understood that in that case, the projec-
tion of the rotating vector on the Y-axis does not give the instantaneous value of that alternating
quantity.
11.25.Vector Diagrams of Sine Waves of Same Frequency
Two or more sine waves of the same frequency can be shown on the same vector diagram be-
cause the various vectors representing
different waves all rotate counter-clock-
wise at the same frequency and main-
tain a fixed position relative to each
other. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.41
where a voltage e and current i of the
same frequency are shown. The cur-
rent wave is supposed to pass upward
through zero at the instant when t = 0
while at the same time the voltage wave
has already advanced an angle α from
its zero value. Hence, their equations
can be written as
Fig. 11.41
i = I sin ωt
m
and e = E sin (ωt + α)
m
Sine wave of different frequencies cannot be represented on the same vector diagram in a still
picture because due to difference in speed of different vectors, the phase angles between them will
be continuously changing.
11.26. Addition of Two
Alternating Quantities
In Fig. 11.42 (a) are shown two
rotating vectors representing the
maximum values of two sinusoidal

sin ωt and e = E sin (ωt − φ). It is seen
2 m2
that the sum of the two sine waves of the
same frequency is another sine wave of
the same frequency but of a different

maximum value and phase. The value of480 Electrical Technology
the instantaneous resultant voltage e, at any instant is obtained by algebraically adding the projections
r
of the two vectors on the Y-axis. If these projections are e and e , then, e = e + e at that time. The
1 2 r 1 2
resultant curve is drawn in this way by adding the ordinates. It is found that the resultant wave is a
sine wave of the same frequency as the component waves but lagging behind E by an angle α. The
m1
vector diagram of Fig. 11.42 (a) can be very easily drawn. Lay off E lagging φº behind E and then
m2 m1
complete the parallelogram to get E.

Example 11.29. Add the following currents as waves and as vectors.
i = 7 sin ωt and i = 10 sin (ωt + π/3)
1 2
Solution. As Waves
i = i + i = 7 sin ωt + 10 sin (ωt + 60º)
r 1 2
= 7 sin ωt + 10 sin ωt cos 60º + 10 cos ωt sin 60º
= 12 sin ωt + 8.66 cos ωt
Dividing both sides by (122 +8.662) = 14.8, we get
i = 14.8 ⎜ ⎛ 12 sinωt+ 8.66 cosωt⎟ ⎞
r ⎝14.8 14.8 ⎠
= 14.8 (cos α sin ωt + sin α cos ωt) Fig. 11.43
where cos α = 12/14.8 and α = 8.66/14.8 —as shown in Fig. 11.43
∴ i = 14.8 sin (ωt + α)
r
where tan α = 8.66/12 or α = tan −1(8.66/12) = 35.8º
∴ i = 14.8 sin (ωt + 35.8º)
r
As Vectors
Vector diagram is shown in Fig. 11.44. Resolving the vectors
into their horizontal and vertical components, we have
X – component = 7 + 10 cos 60º = 12
Y – component = 0 + 10 sin 60º = 8.66
Resultant = (122 +8.662) = 14.8 A
and α = tan −1 (8.66/12) = 35.8º
Hence, the resultant equation can be written as
i = 14.8 sin (ωωωωωt + 35.8º)

11.27. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors
(i) Addition. In a.c. circuit problems we may be concerned with a number of alternating volt-
ages or currents of the same frequency but of different phases and it may be required to obtain the
resultant voltage or current. As explained earlier (Art. 11.23) if the quantities are sinusoidal, they
may be represented by a number of rotating vectors having a common axis of rotation and displaced
from one another by fixed angles which are equal to the phase differences between the respective
alternating quantities. The instantaneous value of the resultant voltage is given by the algebraic sum
of the projections of the different vectors on Y-axis. The maximum value (or r.m.s. value if the
vectors represent that value) is obtained by compounding the several vectors by using the parallelo-
gram and polygon laws of vector addition.
However, another easier method is to resolve the various vectors into their X-and Y-components
and then to add them up as shown in Example 11.30 and 31.A.C. Fundamentals 481
Fig. 11.45
Suppose we are given the following three alternating e.m.fs. and it is required to find the equa-
tion of the resultant e.m.f.
e = 20 sin (ω t + π/3)
1
e = 30 sin (ω t + 3π/4)
2
e = 40 sin (ω t + 4π/3)
3
Then the vector diagram can be drawn as explained before and
solved in any of the following three ways :
(i) By compounding according to parallelogram law as in Fig.
11.45 (a)
(ii) By resolving the various vectors into their X-and Y-com-
ponents as in Fig. 11.45 (b).
(iii) By laying off various vectors end-on end at their proper
phase angles and then measuring the closing vector as shown in
Fig. 11.46.
Knowing the magnitude of the resultant vector and its inclination φ
with X axis, the equation of the resultant e.m.f. can be written as Fig. 11.46
e = E sin (ωt + φ).

Example 11.30. Represent the following quantities by vectors :
5 sin (2π ft − 1) ; 3 cos (2π ft + 1) ; 2 sin (2π ft + 2.5) and 4 sin (2π ft − 1)
Add the vectors and express the result in the form : A sin (2π ft ± Φ)
Solution. It should be noted that all quantities have the same frequency f, hence they can be
represented vertically on the same vector diagram and added as outlined in Art. 11.27. But before
doing this, it would be helpful to express all the quantities as sine functions. Therefore, the second
expression 3 cos (2π ft + 1) can be written as
⎛ π⎞
3 sin ⎜2πft+1+ ⎟ = 3 sin (2π f t + 1 + 1.57) = 3 sin (2π f t + 2.57)

∴ θ = tan −1(−4.75/0.74) = − 81.2º = − 1.43 radians
The equation of the resultant quantity is 4.81 sin (2πππππft −−−−− 1.43)

act together in a circuit. Find an expression for the resultant voltage. Represent them by appropri-
ate vectors. (Electro-technics Madras Univ.) (Elec. Circuit Nagpur Unvi. 1991)
Solution. First, let us draw the three vectors representing the maximum values of the given
alternating voltages.
e = 20 sing ω t − here phase angle with X-axis is zero, hence the vector will be drawn parallel to
1
the X-axis
e = 30 sin (ωt − π/4) − its vector will be below OX by 45°
2
e = 40 cos (ωt + π/6) = 40 sin (90° + ωt + π/6)*
3
= 40 sin (ωt + 120°) − its vector will be at 120° with respect to OX in counter clock-
wise direction.
These vectors are shown in Fig. 11.49 (a). Resolving them into X-and Y-components, we get
X - component = 20 + 30 cos 45° – 40 cos 60°= 21.2 V
Y - component = 40 sin 60° − 30 sin 45° = 13.4 V
* cos θ = sin (90° + θ)A.C. Fundamentals 483
As seen from Fig. 11.49 (b), the maximum value of the resultant voltage is
OD = 21.22 +13.42 =25.1V
Fig. 11.49
The phase angle of the resultant voltage is given by tan φ = Y-component 13.4 0.632
X-component 27.2
∴ φ = tan − 1 0.632 = 32.3° = 0.564 radian
The equation of the resultant voltage wave is e = 25.1 sin (ωt + 32.3°) or e = 25.1 sin (ωt + 0.564)
Example 11.32. Four circuits A, B, C and
D are connected in series across a 240 V, 50-
Hz supply. The voltages across three of the cir-
cuits and their phase angles relative to the cur-

leading. If the supply voltage leads the cur-
rent by 15°, find from a vector diagram drawn
to scale the voltage V across the circuit D and

its phase angle.
Solution. The circuit is shown in Fig. 11.50.
(a) The vector diagram is shown in Fig. 11.50. The
current vector OM is drawn horizontally and is
taken as reference vector. Taking a scale of 1 cm
= 20 V, vector OA is drawn 4 cm in length and
leading OM by an angle of 50°. Vector OB
represents 120 V and is drawn lagging behind OM
by 65°. Their vector sum, as found by
Parallelogram Law of Vectors, is given by vector
OG.
Next, vector OC is drawn ahead of OM by 80°
representing 135 V. Vector OF represents the
vector sum of OG and OC. Vector OE represents
the applied voltage of 240 V and is drawn 15°
ahead of current vector OM. The vector
difference of OE and OF gives the required
voltage V . It is equal to FE. It measures

OH by drawing OH parallel to FE. It is seen that OH lags behind the current vector OM by 12.4°.
Hence, V ' = 109 volts lagging behind the current by 12.4°.

(ii) Subtraction of Vectors
If difference of two vectors is required, then one of the vectors is reversed and this reversed
vector is then compounded with the other vector as usual.
Suppose it is required to subtract vector OB from vector OA. Then OB is reversed as shown in
Fig. 11.52 (a) and compounded with OA according to parallelogram law. The vector difference
(A-B) is given by vector OC.
Similarly, the vector OC in Fig. 12.52 (b) represents (B–A) i.e. the subtraction of OA form OB.

1 2 1 2 m
Solution. (a) The current vectors representing maximum values of the two currents are shown in
Fig. 11.53 (a). Resolving the currents into their X-and Y-components, we get
X- component = 10 cos 45° + 8 cos 60° = 10/ 2+8/2=11.07A
Y- component = 10 sin 45° − 8 sin 60 ° = 0.14 A
∴ I = 11.072 +0.142 =11.08A
m
tan φ = (0.14/11.07) = 0.01265 ∴ φ = 44′
Hence, the equation for the resultant current is i = 11.08 sin (314 t + 44′′′′′) amperes
Fig. 11.53A.C. Fundamentals 485
(b) X − component = 10 cos 45° − 8 cos 60° = 3.07 A
Y − component = 10 sin 45° + 8 sin 60° = 14 A
∴ I = 3.072 +142 =14.33A ...Fig. 11.53 (b)
m
φ = tan − 1 (14/3.07) = 77° 38′
Hence, the equation of the resultant current is
i = 14.33 sin (314 + 77° 38′′′′′) amperes
Example 11.34. The maximum values of the alternating voltage and current are 400 V and 20A

where θ and θ indicate the concerned phase-shifts with respect to some reference. Substituting
1 2
the given instantaneous values at t = 0,
θ = 45° and θ = 30°
1 2
The required expressions are :
V (t) = 400 sin (314 t + 45°)
i (t) = 20 sin (314 t + 30°)
Thus, the voltage leads the current by 15°.
V = RMS voltage = 400/1.414 t = 283 V
I = RMS voltage = 20/1.414 = 14.14 A
Power-factor, cos φ = cos 15° = 0.966 lagging, since current lags behind the voltage.

Putting the value of ‘v’ from above, we get V sin ωt = iR; i= m sinωt ...(ii)

Comparing (i) and (ii), we find that the alternating voltage and current are in phase with each
other as shown in Fig. 11.57. It is also shown vectorially by vectors V and I in Fig. 11.54.

where V = r.m.s. value of applied voltage.
I = r.m.s. value of the current.
It is seen from Fig. 11.58 that no part of the power
cycle becomes negative at any time. In other words, in a
purely resistive circuit, power is never zero. This is so
because the instantaneous values of voltage and current
are always either both positive or negative and hence the Fig. 11.58
product is always positive.

11.30.A.C. Through Pure Inductance Alone
Whenever an alternating voltage is applied to a purely inductive coil*, a back e.m.f. is produced
due to the self-inductance of the coil. The back e.m.f., at every step, opposes the rise or fall of
current through the coil. As there is no ohmic voltage drop,
the applied voltage has to overcome this self-induced e.m.f.

is actually no attainable, though it is very nearly approached by a coil wound with such thick wire that its
resistance is negligible. If it has some actual resistance, then it is represented by a separate equivalent
resistance joined in series with it.490 Electrical Technology

It is also clear from Fig. 11.60 (b) that the average demand of power from the supply for a complete

In Art. 11.30, the applied voltage was a pure sine wave (i.e. without harmonics) given by

then the reactances offered to the fundamental voltage wave and the harmonics would be different.
For the fundamental wave, X = ωL. For 3rd harmonic ; X = 3ωL. For 5th harmonic ; x = 5ωL.
1 3 5
Hence, the current would be given by the equation.

ωL 2 3ωL 2 5ωL 2
* It is assumed that the harmonics have no individual phase differences.492 Electrical Technology
Obviously, the harmonics in the current wave are much smaller than in the voltage wave. For
example, the 5th harmonic of the current wave is of only 1/5th of the harmonic in the voltage wave.
It means that the self-inductance of a coil has the effect of ‘smoothening’ current waveform when
the voltage waveform is complex i.e. contains harmonics.
Example 11.41. The voltage applied to a purely inductive coil of self-inductance 15.9 mH is
given by the equation, v = 100 sin 314 t + 75 sin 942 t + 50 sin 1570 t. Find the equation of the
resulting current wave.
Solution. Here ω = 314 rad/s ∴X = ω L = (15.9 × 10 − 3) × 314 = 5 Ω
1
X = 3ω L = 3 × 5 = 15 Ω; X = 5ω L = 5 × 5 = 25 Ω
3 5
Hence, the current equation is
i = (100/5) sin (314 t − π/2) + (75/15) sin (942t − π/2) + (50/25) sin (1570t − π/2)
or i = 20 sin (314t −−−−− πππππ/2) + 5 sin (942t −−−−− πππππ/2) + 2 sin (1570 t −−−−− πππππ/2)
11.32. A.C. Through Pure Capacitance Alone
When an alternating voltage is applied to the plates of a capacitor, the capacitor is charged first
in one direction and then in the opposite direction. When reference to Fig. 11.62, let
v = p.d. developed between plates at any instant
q = Charge on plates at that instant.
Then q = Cv ...where C is the capacitance

second. It is seen that if the applied voltage is given by
v = V sin ωt, then the current is given by i = I sin (ωt + π/2).
m m
Hence, we find that the current in a pure capacitor leads
its voltage by a quarter cycle as shown in Fig. 11.63 or
phase difference between its voltage and current is π/2 with
the current leading. Vector representation is given in Fig.
11.63. Note that V is taken along the reference axis.

This fact is graphically illustrated in Fig. 11.64. We find that in a purely capacitive circuit **, the

(cid:169) In multi-phase generation of electricity, it is
often convenient to express each phase as a
complex number, Z, which has the form a + jb,
where a and b are real numbers. This represen-
tation is known as Carterian form of Z.498 Electrical Technology
12.1. Mathematical Representation of Vectors
There are various forms or methods of representing vector quantities, all of which enable those
operations which are carried out graphically in a phasor diagram, to be performed analytically. The
various methods are :
(i) Symbolic Notation. According to this method, a vector quantity is expressed algebraically
in terms of its rectangular components. Hence, this form of representation is also known as Rectan-
gular or Cartesian form of notation or representation.
(ii) Trigonometrical Form (iii) Exponential Form (iv) Polar Form.
12.2. Symbolic Notation
A vector can be specified in terms of its X-component and Y-component. For example, the
vector OE (Fig. 12.1) may be completely described
1
by stating that its horizontal component is a and
1
vertical component is b . But instead of stating
1
this verbally, we may express symbolically
E = a + jb
1 1 1
where symbol j, known as an operator, indicates
that component b is perpendicular to component
1
a and that the two terms are not to be treated like
1
terms in any algebraic expression. The vector writ-
ten in this way is said to be written in ‘complex
form’. In Mathematics, a is known as real com-
1
ponent and b as imaginary component but in elec-
1
trical engineering, these are known as in phase (or
active) and quadrature (or reactive) components
respectively.
The other vectors OE , OE and OE can simi- Fig. 12.1
2 3 4
larly, be expressed in this form.
E = −a + jb ; E = −a − jb ; E = +a − jb
2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4
It should be noted that in this book, a vector quantity would be represented by letters in heavy
type and its numerical or scalar value by the same letter in ordinary type.* Other method adopted for
indicating a vector quantity is to put an arrow about the letter such as E.
The numerical value of vector E is a2 +b2 . Its angle with X-axis is given by φ = tan −1 (b /a ).
1 1 1 1 1
12.3. Significance of Operator j
The letter j used in the above expression is a symbol of an operation. Just as symbols ×, + , ∫
etc. are used with numbers for indicating certain operations to be performed on those numbers, simi-
larly, symbol j is used to indicate the counter-clockwise rotation of a vector through 90º. It is as-
signed a value of ( 1) **. The double operation of j on a vector rotates it counter-clockwise
through 180º and hence reverses its sense because
* The magnitude of a vector is sometimes called ‘modulus’ and is represented by | E | or E.
** In Mathematics, (−1) is denoted by i but in electrical engineering j is adopted because letter i is reserved
for representing current. This helps to avoid confusion.Complex Numbers 499
j j = j2 = (−1)2 = −1
When operator j is operated on vector E, we get the new vector jE which is displaced by 90º in
counter-clockwise direction from E (Fig. 12.2). Further application of j will give j2E = −E as shown.
If the operator j is applied to the vector j2E, the result is j3E = −jE. The vector j3E is 270º
counter-clockwise from the reference axis and is directly opposite to jE. If the vector j3E is, turn,
operated on by j, the result will be
j4E = ⎡ ⎣ (−1) ⎤ ⎦ 4 E = E
Hence, it is seen that successive applications
of the operator j to the vector E produce successive
90º steps of rotation of the vector in the counter-
clockwise direction without in anyway affecting the
magnitude of the vector.
It will also be seen from Fig. 12.2 that the ap-
plication of −j to E yields – jE which is a vector of
identical magnitude but rotated 90º clockwise from
E.
Summarising the above, we have
j = 90º ccw rotation = (−1)
j2 = 180º ccw rotation = [ (−1)]2 = −1; Fig. 12.2
j3 = 270º ccw rotation = [ (−1)]3 =− (−1) =− j
j4 = 360º ccw rotation = [ (−1)]4 = + 1;
j5 = 450º ccw rotation = [ (−1)]5 =− (−1) = j
It should also be noted that 1 = j = j =− j
j j2 −1
12.4. Conjugate Complex Numbers
Two complex numbers are said to be conjugate if they differ only in the algebraic sign of their
quadrature components. Accordingly, the numbers (a + jb) and (a − jb) are conjugate. The sum of
two conjugate numbers gives in-phase (or active) component and their difference gives quadrature
(or reactive) component.
12.5. Trigonometrical Form of Vector
From Fig. 12.3, it is seen that X-component of E is E cos θ
and Y-component is E sin θ. Hence, we can represent the vector
E in the form : E = E (cos θ + j sin θ)
This is equivalent to the rectangular form E = a + jb because
a = E cos θ and b = E sin θ. In general, E = E (cos θ ± j sin θ).
12.6. Exponential Form of Vector
It can be proved that e± jθ = (cos θ ± j sin θ) Fig. 12.3
This equation is known as Euler’s equation after the famous mathematician of 18th century :
Leonard Euler.500 Electrical Technology
This equation follows directly from an inspection of Maclaurin* series expansions of sin θ, cos
θ and ejθ .
When expanded into series form :
θ2 θ4 θ6 θ3 θ5 θ7
cos θ = 1 − + − +... and sin θ = θ − + − +...
L2 L4 L6 L3 L5 L7
(jθ)2 (jθ)3 (jθ)4 (jθ)5 (jθ)6
ejθ = 1 + jθ + + + + + +...
L2 L3 L4 L5 L6
Keeping in mind that j2 = −1, j3 = −j, j4 = 1, j5 = −j, j6 = −1, we get
⎛ θ2 θ4 θ6 ⎞ ⎛ θ3 θ5 θ7 ⎞
ejθ
=
⎜1− + − +...⎟+ j⎜θ− + − +...⎟
⎝ L2 L4 L6 ⎠ ⎝ L3 L5 L7 ⎠
∴ ejθ = cos θ + j sin θ
Similarly, it can be shown that e −jθ = cos θ − j sin θ
Hence E = E (cos θ ± y´ sin θ) can be written as E = Ee± jθ . This is known as exponential form of
representing vector quantities. It represents a vector of numerical value E and having phase angle of
± θ with the reference axis.
12.7. Polar Form of Vector Representation
The expression E (cos θ + j sin θ) is written in the simplified form of E ∠θ. In this expression,
E represents the magnitude of the vector and θ its inclination (in ccw direction) with the X-axis. For
angles in clockwise direction the expression becomes E ∠ −θ. In general, the expression is written as
E ∠±θ. It may be pointed out here that E ∠∠∠∠∠± θθθθθ is simply a short-hand or symbolic style of writing
Ee±jθθθθθ
. Also, the form is purely conventional and does not possess the mathematical elegance of the
various other forms of vector representation given above.
Summarizing, we have the following alternate ways of representing vector quantities
(i) Rectangular form (or complex form) E = a + jb
(ii) Trigonometrical form E = E (cos θ ± j sin θ)
(iii) Exponential form E = Ee± jθ
(iv) Polar form (conventional) E = E ∠ ±θ.
Example 12.1. Write the equivalent exponential and
polar forms of vector 3 + j4. How will you illustrate the
vector means of diagram ?
Solution. With reference to Fig. 12.4., magnitude of the
vector is = 32 +42 = 5. tan θ = 4/3.
∴ θ = tan −1 (4/3) = 53.1º
Fig. 12.4
* Functions like cos θ, sin θ and ejθ etc. can be expanded into series form with the help of Maclaurin’s
f′(0)θ f′′(0)θ2 f′′′(0)θ3
Theorem. The theorem states : f (θ) = f (0) + + + +... where f (θ) is function of θ
1 ∠2 ∠3
which is to be expanded, f (0) is the value of the function when θ = 0, f ′(0) is the value of first derivative
of f (θ) when θ = 0, f ″(0) is the value of second derivative of function f (θ) when θ = 0 etc.Complex Numbers 501
∴ Exponential form = 5 ej53.1º
The angle may also be expressed in radians.
Polar form = 5 ∠53.1º.
Example 12.2. A vector is represented by 20 e
−j2π/3.
Write the various equivalent forms of the
vector and illustrate by means of a vector diagram, the magnitude and posi-
tion of the above vector.
Solution. The vector is drawn in a direction making an angle of 2π/3 =
120º in the clockwise direction (Fig. 12.5). The clockwise direction is taken
because the angle is negative.
(i) Rectangular Form a = 20 cos (−120º) = −10 ;
b = 20 sin (−120º) = −17.32
∴ Expression is = (−10 − j17.32)
(ii) Polar Form is 20 ∠ − 120º

12.8. Addition and Subtraction of Vector Quantities
Rectangular form is best suited for addition and subtraction of vector quantities. Suppose we
are given two vector quantities E = a + jb and E = a + jb and it is required to find their sum and
1 1 1 2 2 2
difference.
Addition. E = E + E = a + jb + a + jb = (a + a ) + j(b + b )
1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2
The magnitude of resultant vector E is (a +a )2 +(b +b )2

12.9.Multiplication and Division of Vector Quantities
Multiplication and division of vectors becomes very simple and easy if they are represented in
the polar or exponential form. As will be shown below, the rectangular form of representation is not
well-suited for this process.
(i) Multiplication – Rectangular form
Let the two vectors be given by A = a + jb and B = a + jb
1 1 2 2
∴ A × B = C = (a + jb ) (a + jb ) = a a + j2b b + j (a b + b a )
1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
= (a a − b b ) + j (a b + b a ) (∵ j2 = − 1)
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
The magnitude of C = [(aa −b b )2 +(ab +ba )2]
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
In angle with respect to X-axis is given by θ = tan −1 ⎛ ⎜ a 1 b 2 +b 1 a 2 ⎞ ⎟
⎝aa −bb ⎠
1 2 1 2
A a + jb (a + jb)(a − jb )
(ii) Division – Rectangular Form : = 1 1 = 1 1 2 2
B a + jb (a + jb )(a − jb )
2 2 2 2 2 2
Both the numerator and denominator have been multiplied by the conjugate of (a + jb ) i.e. by
2 2
(a − jb )
2 2
∴ A = (a 1 a 2 +b 1 b 2 )+ j(b 1 a 2 −a 1 b 2 ) = a 1 a 2 +a 1 b 2 + j b 1 a 2 +a 1 b 2
B a2 +b2 a2 +b2 a2 +b2
2 2 2 2 2 2
The magnitude and the angle with respects X-axis can be found in the same way as given above.
As will be noted, both the results are somewhat awkward but unfortunately, there is no easier way
to perform multiplication in rectangular form.
(iii) Multiplication – Polar Form
Let A = a + jb = A ∠α = A ejα where α = tan −1 (b /a )
1 1 1 1
B = a + jb = B ∠β = B ejβ where β = tan −1 (b /a )
2 2 2 2
∴ AB = A∠α × B ∠β = AB ∠ (α + β)* or AB = Aejα × Bejβ = ABe j(α + β)
Hence, product of any two vector A and B is given by another vector equal in length to A × B and
having a phase angle equal to the sum of the angles of A and B.
A = A∠α = A∠(α−β)
B B ∠β B
Hence, the quotient A ÷÷÷÷÷ B is another vector having a magnitude of A ÷÷÷÷÷ B and phase angle equal
to angle of A minus the angle of B.

As seen, the division and multiplication become extremely simple if vectors are represented in
their polar or exponential form.
Example 12.3. Add the following vectors given in rectangular form and illustrate the process
graphically.
A = 16 + j 12, B = − 6 + j 10.4
* A = A (cos α + j sin α) and B = B (cos β + j sin β)
∴ AB = AB (cos α cos β + j sin α cos β + j cos α sin β + j2 sin α sin β)
= AB[cos α cos β − sin α sin β) + j (sin α cos β + cos α sin β)]
= AB[cos (α + β) + j sin (α + β)] = AB ∠(α + β)Complex Numbers 503
Solution. A + B = C = (16 + j 12) + (− 6 + j 10.4) = 10 + j 22.4
∴ Magnitude of C = (102 +22.42) =25.5units

The vector addition is shown in Fig. 12.8.
α = tan −1 (12/16) = 36.9°
β = tan −1 (− 10.4/6) = − 240° or 120°
The resultant vector is found by using parallelogram law of vectors
(Fig. 12.8). Fig. 12.8
Example 12.4. Perform the following operation and express the final result in the polar form :
5 ∠ 30° + 8 ∠ − 30°. (Elect. Engg. & Electronics Bangalore Univ. 1989)
Solution. 5 ∠ 30° = 5 (cos 30° + j sin 30°) = 4.33 + j 2.5
8 ∠ − 30° = 8 [cos (− 30°) + j sin (− 30°)] = 8 (0.866 − 0.5) = 6.93 − j 4
∴ 5∠30° + 8∠−30° = 4.33 + j2.5 + 6.93 − j4 = 11.26 − j1.5 = 11.262+1.52 ∠tan −1 (−1.5/11.26) = 11.35
tan − 1 (− 0.1332) = 11.35 ∠ 7.6°
Example 12.5. Subtract the following given vectors from one another :
A = 30 + j 52 and B = − 39.5 − j 14.36
Solution. A −−−−− B = C = (30 + j 52) − (− 39.5 − j 14.36) = 69.5 + j 66.36
∴ Magnitude of C = (66.52 +66.362) =96
Slope of C = tan −1 (66.36/69.5) = 43.6° ∴ C = 96 ∠ 43.6°.
Similarly B −−−−− A = − 69.5 − j 66.36 = 96 ∠223.6º* or = 96 ∠− 136.4°
Example 12.6. Given the following two vectors :
A = 20 ∠ 60° and B = 5 ∠ 30°
Perform the following indicated operations and illustrate graphically (i) A × B and (ii) A/B.
Solution. (i) A ××××× B = C = 20 ∠ 60° × 5 ∠ 30° = 100 ∠ 90°
Vectors are shown in Fig. 12.9.
Fig. 12.9 Fig. 12.10
* tan θ = 66.36/69.5 or θ = tan−1 (66.36/69.5) = 43.6°. Since both components are negative, the vector lies
in third quadrant. Hence, the angle measured from + ve direction of X-axis and in the CCW directions is
= (180 + 43.6) = 223.6°.504 Electrical Technology
(ii) A =
20∠60°
=4∠30° —Fig. 12.10
B 5∠30°
Example 12.7. Perform the following operation and the final result may be given in the polar
form : (8 + j6) × (−10 − j 7.5) (Elect. Engg. & Electronics Bangalore Univ. 1990)
Solution. We will use the following two methods to solve the above question.
Method No. 1
We know that multiplication of (A + B) and (C + D) can be found as under :
A + B
× C + D
CA + CB
+ DA + DB
CA + CD + DA + DB
Similarly, the required multiplication can be carried out as follows :
8 + j 6
× − 10 − j 7.5
− 80 − j 60
− j 60 − j2 45
− 80 − j120 + 45
or − 35 − j120 = (−35)2 +(−120)2 tan −1(120/35)=125tan −13.42=125 73.8°
Since both the components of the vector are negative, it obviously lies in the third quadrant. As
measured from the X-axis in the CCW direction, its angle is = 180° + 73.8° = 253.8°. Hence, the
product vector can be written as 125 ∠ 53.8°.
Method No. 2 8 + j 6 = 10 ∠ 36.9°, - 10 - j 7.5 = 12.5 tan-1 0.75 = 12.5 ∠ 36.9°.
Again as explained in Method 1 above, the actual angle of the vector is 180° + 36.9° = 216.9°
∴ − 10 − j 7.5 = 12.5 ∠ 216.9 ∴ 10 ∠ 36.9° × 12.5 ∠ 216.9° = 125 < 253.8°
Example 12.8. The following three vectors are given :
A = 20 + j20, B = 30 ∠−120 and C = 10 + j0
Perform the following indicated operations :
AB BC
(i) and (ii) .

Solution. The maximum value of first current is 10 A and it leads the reference quantity by 45°.
The second current can be written as
i = 5 cos (ωt − π/2) = 5 sin [90 + (ωt − π/2)] = 5 sin ωt
2
Hence, its maximum value is 5 A and is in phase with the reference quantity.
∴ I = 10 (cos 45° + j sin 45°) = (7.07 + j 7.07)

∴ R.M.S. value = 14/ 2 = 10 A
12.10. Power and Roots of Vectors
(a) Powers
Suppose it is required to find the cube of the vector 3 ∠ 15°. For this purpose, the vector has to
be multiplied by itself three times.
∴ (3 ∠ 15)3 = 3 × 3 × 3. ∠ (15° + 15° + 15°) = 27 ∠ 45°. In general, An = An ∠ nα
Hence, nth power of vector A is a vector whose magnitude is An and whose phase angle with
respect to X-axis is nα.
It is also clear that AnBn = AnBn ∠ (nα + nβ)
(b) Roots
It is clear that 3(8∠45°) = 2 ∠ 15°
In general, nA = n A=∠α/n
Hence, nth root of a vector A is a vector whose magnitude is n A and whose phase angle with
respect to X-axis is α/n.
12.11. The 120° Operator
In three-phase work where voltage vectors are displaced from one another by 120°, it is conve-
nient to employ an operator which rotates a vector through 120° forward or backwards without changing
its length. This operator is ‘a’. Any operator which is multiplied by ‘a’ remains unchanged in
magnitude but is rotated by 120° in the counter-clockwise (ccw) direction.
∴ α = 1 ∠ 120°
This, when expressed in the cartesian form, becomes
a = cos 120° + j sin 120° = − 0.5 + j 0.866
Similarly, a2 = 1 ∠ 120° × 1 ∠ 120° = 1 ∠ 240° = cos 240° + j sin
240° = − 0.5 − j 0.866
Hence, operator ‘a2’ will rotate the vector in ccw by 240°. This is the
same as rotating the vector in clockwise direction by 120°.
∴ a2 = 1 ∠ − 120°. Similarly, a3 = 1 ∠ 360° = 1*
As shown in Fig. 12.11, the 3-phase voltage vectors with standard
phase sequence may be represented as E, a2E and aE or as E, E (− 0.5 − j
Fig. 12.11
0.866) and E (− 0.5 + j 0.866)
It is easy to prove that
(i) a2 + a = − 1 (ii) a2 + a + 1 = 0 (iii) a3 + a2 + a = 0
Note. We have seen in Art. 12.3 that operator − j turns a vector through − 90° i.e. through 90° in clockwise
direction. But it should be clearly noted that operator ‘− a’ does not turn a vector through − 120°. Rather ‘ −
a’ turns a vector through − 60° as shown below.

Fig. 13.1 Fig. 13.2
These voltage drops are shown in voltage triangle OAB in Fig. 13.2. Vector OA represents ohmic
drop V and AB represents inductive drop V . The applied voltage V is the vector sum of the two i.e.

∴ V = (V R 2 V L 2) [(IR)2 (I.X L )2] I R2 X L 2 , (R2 V X2) I

The quantity (R2 + X2) is known as the impedance (Z) of the circuit. As seen from the
L
impedance triangle ABC (Fig. 13.3) Z2 = R2 + X 2.
L
i.e. (Impedance)2 = (resistance)2 + (reactance)2
From Fig. 13.2, it is clear that the applied voltage V leads the current I by an angle φ such that
tan φ = V L = I.X L = X L = ωL = reactance ∴ φ =tan −1 X L

The same fact is illustrated graphically in Fig. 13.4.
In other words, current I lags behind the applied voltage V by an angle φ.
Hence, if applied voltage is given by ν = V sin ω t, then current equation is

In Fig. 13.5, I has been resolved into its two mutually perpendicular components, I cos φ along
the applied voltage V and I sin φ in quadrature (i.e. perpendicular) with V.
Fig. 13.5 Fig. 13.6
The mean power consumed by the circuit is given by the product of V and that component of the
current I which is in phase with V.
So P = V × I cos φ = r.m.s. voltage × r.m.s. current × cos φ
The term ‘cos φ’ is called the power factor of the circuit.
Remember that in an a.c. circuit, the product of r.m.s. volts and r.m.s. amperes gives volt-
amperes (VA) and not true power in watts. True power (W) = volt-amperes (VA) × power factor.
or Watts = VA ××××× cos φφφφφ*
It should be noted that power consumed
is due to ohmic resistance only because pure
inductance does not consume any power.
Now P = VI cos φ = VI × (R/Z) = (V/Z)
× I. R = I2 R (ä cos φ = R/Z) or
P = I2 R watt
Graphical representation of the power
consumed is shown in Fig. 14.6.
Let us calculate power in terms of in-
stantaneous values.

13.3. Active and Reactive Components of Circuit Current I
Active component is that which is in phase with the
applied voltage V i.e. I cos φ. It is also known as ‘wattful’
component.
Reactive component is that which in quadrature with
V i.e. I sin φ. It is also known as ‘wattless’ or ‘idle’ com-
ponent.
It should be noted that the product of volts and am-
peres in an a.c. circuit gives voltamperes (VA). Out of
this, the actual power is VA cos φ = W and reactive power
is VA sin φ. Expressing the values in kVA, we find that it
has two rectangular components :
(i) active component which is obtained by multi-
Fig. 13.10
plying kVA by cos φ and this gives power in kW.Series A.C. Circuits 511
(ii) the reactive component known as reactive kVA and is obtained by multiplying kVA by sinφ.
It is written as kVAR (kilovar). The following relations can be easily deduced.
kVA = kW2 +kVAR2 ; kW = kVA cos φ and kVAR = kVA sin φ
These relationships can be easily understood by referring to the kVA triangle of Fig. 13.10
where it should be noted that lagging kVAR has been taken as negative.
For example, suppose a circuit draws a current of 1000 A at a voltage of 20,000 V and has a
power factor of 0.8. Then
input = 1,000 × 20,000/1000 = 20,000 kVA; cos φ = 0.8; sin φ= 0.6
Hence kW = 20,000 × 0.8 = 16,000 ; kVAR = 20,000 × 0.6 = 12,000
Obviously, 160002 +120002 = 20,000 i.e. kVA = kW2 +kVAR2
13.4. Active, Reactive and Apparent Power
Let a series R-L circuit draw a current of I when an
alternating voltage of r.m.s. value V is applied to it. Sup-
pose that current lags behind the applied voltage by φ.
The three powers drawn by the circuit are as under :
(i) apparent power (S)
It is given by the product of r.m.s. values of applied
voltage and circuit current.
∴ S = VI = (IZ) . I = I2 Z volt-amperes (VA)
(ii) active power (P or W)
It is the power which is actually dissipated in the cir-
cuit resistance. P = I2R = VI cos φ watts Fig. 13.11
(iii) reactive power (Q)
It is the power developed in the inductive reactance of the circuit.
Q = I2X = I2 . Z sin φ = I . (IZ). sin φ = VI sin φ volt-amperes-reactive (VAR)
L
These three powers are shown in the power triangle of Fig. 13.11 from where it can be seen that
S2 = P2 + Q2 or S = P2 +Q2
13.5. Q-factor of a Coil
Reciprocal of power factor is called the Q-factor of a coil or its figure of merit. It is also known
as quality factor of the coil.
Q factor = 1 = 1 = Z

Hence, current lags behind voltage by 30°. It means that it is an R-L circuit. Also 314 = 2π f or
f = 50 Hz. Now, R/Z = cos 30° = 0.866; R = 2.6 Ω ; X /Z = sin 30° = 0.5

Solution. (i) From the voltage equation, it is seen that the voltage lags behind the reference
quantity by 2π/3 radian or 2 × 180/3 = 120°. Similarly, current lags behind the reference quantity by
π/2 radian or 180/2 = 90°. Between themselves, voltage lags behind the current by (120 − 90) = 30°
as shwon in Fig. 13.12 (b).

(iii) Average power = VI cos φ = 100 × 5 × cos 30° = 433 W
(iv) At t = 0 ; v = 141.4 sin (0 − 120°) = − 122.45 V; i = 7.07 sin (0 − 90°) = − 7.07 A.
∴ instantaneous power at t = 0 is given by vi = (− 122.45) × (− 7.07) = 865.7 W.

Solution. Let R be the d.c. resistance and L be the inductance of the coil.
∴ R = V/I = 4.5/9 = 0.5 Ω;

Solution. (i) Z = R2+(2π×50L)2 = R2+98696L2;V =IZ or 10=700×10 −3 (R2+98696L2)
(R2 +98696L2) = 10/700 × 10 −3 = 100/7 or R2 + 98696 L2 = 10000/49 ...(i)
(ii) In the second case Z = R2 +(2π×75L)2 = (R2 +222066L2)
∴ 10 = 500 × 10 −3 (R2 +222066L2) i.e. (R2 +222066L2) = 20 or R2 + 222066L2 = 400 (ii)
Subtracting Eq. (i) from (ii), we get
222066 L2 − 98696 L2 = 400 − (10000/49) or 123370 L2 = 196 or L = 0.0398 H = 40 mH.
Substituting this value of L in Eq. (ii), we get, R2 + 222066 (0.398)2 = 400 ∴ R = 6.9 ΩΩΩΩΩ.....

Solution. Power will be found by the conjugate method. Using current conjugate, we have

Hence, real power is 500 W and reactive power of VAR is 250. Since the second term in the
above expression is positive, the reactive volt-amperes of 250 are inductive.*

tive. (Elect. Technology, Nagpur Univ. 1991)
Solution. V = 0 + j10 = ∠90°; I = 0.8 + j0.6 = 1∠36.9°
As seen, V leads the reference quantity by 90° whereas I leads
by 36.9°. In other words , I lags behind the applied voltage by (90°

Hence, the circuit of Fig. 13.14 is an R-L circuit. Fig. 13.14
Now, Z = V/I = 10 ∠90°/1 ∠36.9° = 10 ∠53.1° = 6 + j8

Solution. The current can be written as i = 10 2sin (314 t − 25° + 90°) = 10 2 sin (314 t + 65°).
It is seen that applied voltage leads by 20° and current leads by 65° with regards to the reference
quantity, their mutual phase difference is = 65° − (20°) = 45°. Hence, p.f. = cos 45° = 1/ 2(lead).

Example 13.17. A 120-V, 60-W lamp is to be operated on 220-V, 50-Hz supply mains. Calcu-
late what value of (a) non-inductive resistance (b) pure inductance would be required in order that
lamp is run on correct voltage. Which method is preferable and why ?
Solution. Rated current of the bulb = 60/120 = 0.5 A

connected in series with the lamp
in Fig. 13.15 (a).
P.D. across R is V = 220 − 1200
R

(b) P.D. across bulb = 120 V
P.D. across L is

(Remember that V is in quadrature with V –the voltage across the bulb).

Now, V = 0.5 × X or 184.4 = 0.5 × L × 2π × 50 ∴ L = 184.4/0.5 × 3.14 = 1.17 H
L L
Method (b) is preferable to (a) because in method (b), there is no loss of power. Ohmic resis-
tance of 200 Ω itself dissipates large power (i.e. 100 × 0.5 = 50 W).

Solution. As seen from the vector diagram of Fig. 13.17 (b).
BC2 + CD2 = 2002 ...(i) (125 + BC)2 + CD2 = 2502 ...(ii)
Subtracting Eq. (i) from (ii), we get, (125 + BC)2 − BC2 = 2502 − 2002

Solution. The frequency of
the applied voltage is f = 377/2π

Since coil reactance is
1.25 Ω at 25 Hz, its value at 60
Hz = 1.25 × 60/25 = 3 Ω Fig. 13.19
Coil impedance, Z = 42 +32,=5Ω; φ = tan −1 (3/4) = 36°52′
It means that circuit current lags behind the applied voltage by 36°52′ . Hence, equation of the
circuit current is
i = (141.4/5) sin (377 t + 30° − 36°52′ ) = 28.3 sin (377 t − 6°52′ )
Since, resistance drop is in phase with current, its equation is e = iR = 113.2 sin (377 t − 6°52′ )

The inductive voltage drop leads the current by 90°, hence its equation is

Hence, it means that if the equation of the
applied alternating voltage is v = V sin ωt, the
m
equation of the resultant current in the R-C circuit
is i = I sin (ωt + φ) so that current leads the ap-
m
plied voltage by an angle φ. This fact is shown
graphically in Fig. 13.25.

Alternative Method for Power
The method of conjugates will be used to determine the
real power and reactive volt-ampere. It is a convenient way
of calculating these quantities when both voltage and cur-
Fig. 13.26
rent are expressed in cartesian form. If the conjugate of
current is multiplied by the voltage in cartesian form, the result is a complex quantity, the real part of
which gives the real power j part of which gives the reactive volt-amperes (VAR). It should, however,
be noted that real power as obtained by this method of conjugates is the same regardless of whether V
or I is reversed although sign of voltamperes will depend on the choice of V or I.*
Using current conjugate, we get P = (80 + j 60) (− 4 − j 10) = 280 − j 1040
VA
∴ Power consumed = 280 W

(iii)Is the circuit inductive or capacitive ? (iv) What is the value of active and reactive power in
the circuit ? (Basic Electricity, Bombay Univ.)
Solution. The applied voltage lags behind the current which, in other words, means that current
leads the voltage.
(i) ∴ p.f. is leading (ii) p.f. = cos φ = cos 30° = 0.866 (lead) (iii) Circuit is capacitive
(iv) Active power = VI cos φ = 100 × 10 × 0.866 = 866 W
Reactive power = VI sin φ = 100 × 10 × 0.5 = 500 VAR (lead)
or VAR = (VA)2 −W2 = (100×10)2 −8662 = 500 (lead)
* If voltage conjugate is used, then capacitive VARs are positive and inductive VARs negative. If current
conjugate is used, then capacitive VARs are negative and inductive VARs are positive.Series A.C. Circuits 527

(Elect. Engg.-I, Calcutta Univ.)
Solution. Time-period of the alternating voltage is 1/50 second. Now a time interval of 1/50
second corresponds to a phase difference of 2 π radian or 360°. Hence, a time interval of 1/900
second corresponds to a phase difference of 360 × 50/900 = 20°.

Example 13.38. A capacitor and a non-inductive resistance are connected in series to a 200-V,
single-phase supply. When a voltmeter having a non-inductive resistance of 13,500 Ω is connected
across the resistor, it reads 132 V and the current then taken from the supply is 22.35 mA.
Indicate on a vector diagram, the voltages across the two components and also the supply
current (a) when the voltmeter is connected and (b) when it is disconnected.
Solution. The circuit and vector diagrams are shown in Fig. 13.28 (a) and (b) respectively.
(a) V = 2002 −1322 =150 V
C
It is seen that φ = tan −1 (150/132) = 49° in Fig. 13.28 (b). Hence
(i) Supply voltage lags behind the current by 49°. (ii) V leads supply voltage by 49° (iii) V
R C
lags behind the supply voltage by (90° − 49°) = 41°
The supply current is, as given equal to 22.35 mA. The value of unknown resistance R can be
found as follows :
Current through voltmeter = 132/13,500 = 9.78 mA
∴ Current through R = 22.35 − 9.78 = 12.57 mA ∴ R = 132/12.57 × 10 −3 = 10,500 Ω ;
X = 150/22.35 × 10 −3 = 6.711 Ω

∴ φ = 32.5°.
In this case, the supply voltage lags the circuit current by 32.5° as shown in Fig. 13.28 (c).
Example 13.39. It is desired to operate a 100-W, 120-V electric lamp at its current rating from

presented to the supply in each case and which method is the most economical of power.
(Principles of Elect. Engg.-I, Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. Rated current of the bulb is = 100/120 = 5/6 A
The bulb can be run at its correct rating by any one of the three methods shown in Fig. 13.29. (a)
With reference to Fig. 13.29 (a), we have
P.D. across R = 240 − 120 = 120 V
∴ R = 120/(5/6) = 144 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Power factor of the circuit is unity. Power consumed = 240 × 5/6 = 200 W

(b) Referring to Fig. 13.29 (b), we have
V = 2402 −1202 =207.5V;X =207.5(5/6)=249Ω
C C
∴ 1/314 C = 249 or C = 12.8 μF; p.f. = cos φ = 120/240 = 0.5 (lead)
Power consumed = 240 × (5/6) × 0.5 = 100 W

V = (5/6) × 10 = 25/3 V ∴ V = 2402 − 120+ 25 =203V
R L 3
∴ 314 L × (5/6) = 203 ∴ L = 0.775 H
Total resistive drop = 120 + (25/3) = 128.3 V; cos φ = 128.3/240 = 0.535 (lag)
Power consumed = 240 × (5/6) × 0.535 = 107 W
Method (b) is most economical because it involves least consumption of power.
Example 13.40. A two-element series circuit consumes 700 W and has a p.f. = 0.707 leading.
If applied voltage is v = 141.1 sin (314 t + 30°), find the circuit constants.
Solution. The maximum value of voltage is 141.4 V and it leads the reference quantity by 30°.
Hence, the given sinusoidal voltage can be expressed in the phase form as
V = (141.4/ 2)∠30°=100∠30° now, P = VI cos φ ∴ 700 = 100 × I × 0.707; I = 10 A.
Since p.f. = 0.707 (lead); φ = cos −1 (0.707) = 45° (lead).
It means that current leads the given voltage by 45° for it leads the common reference quantity530 Electrical Technology
by (30° + 45°) = 75°. Hence, it can be expressed as I = 10 ∠ 75°
Z =

13.8. Dielectric Loss and Power Factor of a Capacitor
An ideal capacitor is one in which there are no losses and whose current leads the voltage by 90°
as shown in Fig. 13.30 (a). In practice, it is impossible to get
such a capacitor although close approximation is achieved by
proper design. In every capacitor, there is always some dielec-
tric loss and hence it absorbs some power from the circuit. Due
to this loss, the phase angle is somewhat less than 90° [Fig. 13.30
(b)]. In the case of a capacitor with a poor dielectric, the loss
can be considerable and the phase angle much less than 90°.
This dielectric loss appears as heat. By phase difference is
meant the difference between the ideal and actual phase angles.
As seen from Fig. 13.30 (b), the phase difference ψ is given by
ψ = 90 − φ where φ is the actual phase angle, sin ψ = sin (90 − φ)
= cos φ where cos φ is the power factor of the capacitor. Fig. 13.30
Since ψ is generally small, sin ψ = ψ (in radians) ∴ tan ψ = ψ = cos φ.
It should be noted that dielectric loss increases with the frequency of the applied voltage. Hence
phase difference increases with the frequency f.
The dielectric loss of an actual capacitor is allowed for by imagining it to consist of a pure
capacitor having an equivalent resistance either in series or in parallel with it as shown in Fig. 13.31.
These resistances are such that I2 R loss in them is equal to the dielectric loss in the capacitor.

In voltage triangle of Fig. 13.33 (b), OA represents V , AB and AC represent the inductive and

L C
they are in direct opposition to each other.
Subtracting BD (= AC) from AB, we get the net reactive drop AD = I (X − X )

Example 13.47. A non-inductive resistor is connected in series with a coil and a capacitor. The
circuit is connected to a single-phase a.c. supply. If the voltages are as indicated in Fig. 13.37 when
current flowing through the circuit is 0.345 A, find the applied voltage and the power loss in coil.
(Elect. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. It may be kept in mind that the coil has not only inductance L but also some resistance
r which produces power loss. In the voltage vector diagram, AB represents drop across R = 25 V.
Vector BC represents drop across coil which is due to L and r. Which value is 40 V and the vector BC
is at any angle of φ with the current vector. AD represents 50 V which is the drop across R and coil
combined. AE represents the drop across the capacitor and leads the current by 90°.
It will be seen that the total horizontal drop in the circuit is AC and the vertical drop is AG. Their
vector sum AF represents the applied voltage V.
From triangle ABD, we get 502 = 402 + 252 + 2 × 25 × 40 × cos φ ∴ cos φ = 0.1375 and
sin φ = 0.99. Considering the coil, IZ = 40 ∴ Z = 40/0.345 = 115.94 Ω

Now r = Z cos φ = 115.94 × 0.1375 = 15.94 Ω

Power loss in the coil = I2r = 0.3452 × 15.94 = 1.9 W
BC = BD cos φ = 40 × 0.1375 = 5.5 V; CD = BD sin φ = 40 × 0.99 = 39.6 V
AC = 25 + 5.5 = 30.5 V; AG = AE − DC = 55 − 39.6 = 15.4 V
AF = AC2 +CF2 = 30.52 +15.42 = 34.2 V

Example 13.48. A 4.7 H inductor which has a
resistance of 20 Ω, a 4-μF capacitor and a 100-Ω non-
inductive resistor are connected in series to a 100-V, 50-Hz
supply. Calculate the time interval between the positive
peak value of the supply voltage and the next peak value of
power.
Solution. Total resistance = 120 Ω; X = 2π × 50 × 4.7

X = 106/2π × 50 × 4 = 796 Ω; X = 1477 − 798 = 681 Ω;

Z = 1202 +6812 =691.3Ω
cos φ = R/Z = 120/691.3 = 0.1736; φ = 80°
Fig. 13.38
Now, as seen from Fig. 13.38, the angular displace-536 Electrical Technology
ment between the peak values of supply voltage and power cycles is BC = φ/2 because AB = 90-φ and
AD = 180 – φ.
Hence AC = 90 − φ/2
∴ BC = AC − AB = (90 − φ/2) − (90 − φ) = φ/2
Angle difference = φ/2 = 80°/2 = 40°
Since a full cycle of 360° corresponds to a time interval of 1.50 second
∴ 40° angular interval = 40 = 2.22 ms.

Example 13.49. A coil is in series with a 20 μF capacitor across a 230-V, 50-Hz supply. The
current taken by the circuit is 8 A and the power consumed is 200 W. Calculate the inductance of the
coil if the power factor of the circuit is (i) leading (ii) lagging.
Sketch a vector diagram for each condition and calculate the coil power factor in each case.
(Elect. Engg.-I Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. (i) Since power factor is leading, net reactance X = (X − X ) as shown in Fig.
C L
13.39(a).
I2R = 200 or 82 × R = 200; ∴ R = 200/64 = 25/8 Ω = 3.125 Ω
Z = V/I = 230/8 = 28.75 Ω; X = 106/2π × 50 × 20 = 159.15 Ω
C
R + X = 28.752 ∴ X = 28.58 Ω ∴ (X − X ) = 28.58 or 159.15 − X = 28.58
2 2 C L L
∴ X = 130.57 Ω or 2π × 50 × L = 130.57 ∴ L = 0.416 H
L
If θ is the p.f. angle of the coil, then tan θ = R/X = 3.125/130.57 = 0.024 ; θ = 1.37°, p.f. of the
L
coil = 0.9997
(ii) When power factor is lagging, net reactance is (X − X ) as shown in Fig. 13.39 (b).
L C
∴ X − 159.15 = 28.58 or X = 187.73 Ω ∴ 187.73 = 2π × 50 × L or L = 0.597 H.
L L
In this case, tan θ = 3.125/187.73 = 0.0167 ; θ = 0.954° ∴ cos θ = 0.9998.

13.10. Resonance in R-L-C Circuits
We have seen from Art. 13.9 that net reactance in an R-L-C circuit of Fig. 13.40 (a) is
X = X − X andZ = [R2 +(X − X )2]= R2 + X2
L C L C
Let such a circuit be connected across an a.c. source of constant voltage V but of frequency
varying from zero to infinity. There would be a certain frequency of the applied voltage which would
make X equal to X in magnitude. In that case, X = 0 an Z = R as shown in Fig. 13.40 (c). Under this
L C
condition, the circuit is said to be in electrical resonance.
As shown in Fig. 13.40 (c), V = I. X and V = I. X and the two are equal in magnitude but
L L C C
opposite in phase. Hence, they cancel each other out. The two reactances taken together act as a
short-circuit since no voltage develops across them. Whole of the applied voltage drops across R so
that V = V . The circuit impedance Z = R. The phasor diagram for series resonance is shown in Fig.
R
13.40 (d).
Calculation of Resonant Frequency
The frequency at which the net reactance of the series circuit is zero is called the resonant fre-
quency f . Its value can be found as under : X − X = 0 or X = X or ωL = 1/ωC
0 L C L C 0 0
or ω2 = 1 or (2πf )2 = 1 or f = 1
0 LC 0 LC 0 2π LC
If L is in henry and C in farad, then f is given in Hz.
0
When a series R-L-C circuit is in resonance, it possesses minimum impedance Z = R. Hence,
circuit current is maximum, it being limited by value of R alone. The current I =V/R and is in phase
0
with V.
Fig. 13.44
Since circuit current is maximum, it produces large voltage drops across L and C. But these
drops being equal and opposite, cancel each other out. Taken together, L an C from part of a circuit
across which no voltage develops, however, large the current flowing. If it were not for the presence
of R, such a resonant circuit would act like a short-circuit to currents of the frequency to which it
resonates. Hence, a series resonant circuit is sometimes called acceptor circuit and the series reso-
nance is often referred to as voltage resonance.
In fact, at resonance the series RLC circuit is reduced to a purely resistive circuit, as shown in
Fig. 13.44.
Incidentally, it may be noted that if X and X are shown at any frequency f, that the value of the
L C
resonant frequency of such a circuit can be found by the relation f = f X /X .

13.11. Graphical Representation of Resonance
Suppose an alternating voltage of constant magnitude, but of varying frequency is applied to an
R-L-C circuit. The variations of resistance, inductive reactance X and capacitive reactance X with
L C
frequency are shown in Fig. 13.45 (a).
(i) Resistance : It is independent of f, hence, it is represented by a straight line.
(ii) Inductive Reactance : It is given by X = ωL = 2π fL. As seen, X is directly proportional
L L
to f i.e. X increases linearly with f. Hence, its graph is a straight line passing through the origin.
L
(iii) Capacitive Reactance : It is given by X = 1/ωC = 1/2π fC. Obviously, it is inversely propor-
C
tional to f. Its graph is a rectangular hyperbola which is drawn in the fourth quadrant because X is
C
regarded negative. It is asymptotic to the horizontal axis at high frequencies and to the vertical axis
at low frequencies.
(iv) Net Reactance : It is given by X = X ~ X . Its graph is a hyperbola (not rectangular) and
L C
crosses the X-axis at point A which represents resonant frequency f .
0
(v) Circuit Impedance : It is given by Z = [R2 +(X ~ X )2]= R2 + X2
L C
At low frequencies Z is large because X is large. Since X > X , the net circuit reactance
C C L
X is capacitive and the p.f. is leading [Fig. 13.45 (b)]. At high frequencies, Z is again large (because
X is large) but is inductive because X > X . Circuit impedance has minimum values at f given by
L L C 0
Z = R because X = 0.
Fig. 13.45
(vi) Current I : It is the reciprocal of the circuit impedance. When Z is low, I is high and vice
0 0
versa. As seen, I has low value on both sides of f (because Z is large there) but has maximum value
0 0
of I = V/R at resonance. Hence, maximum power is dissipated by the series circuit under resonant
0
conditions. At frequencies below and above resonance, current decreases as shown in Fig. 13.45
* However, value of Q is as given in Art 13.5, 13.9 and 13.17.

(vii) Power Factor
As pointed out earlier, X is capacitive below f . Hence, current leads the applied voltage. How-

ever, at frequencies above f , X is inductive. Hence, the current lags the applied voltage as shown in
0
Fig. 13.45. The power factor has maximum value of unity at f .

13.12. Resonance Curve
The curve, between circuit current and the frequency
of the applied voltage, is known as resonance curve. The
shapes of such a curve, for different values of R are shown
in Fig. 13.46. For smaller values of R, the resonance
curve is sharply peaked and such a circuit is said to be
sharply resonant or highly selective. However, for larger
values of R, resonance curve is flat and is said to have
poor selectivity. The ability of a resonant circuit to dis-
criminate between one particular frequency and all oth-
ers is called its selectivity. The selectivities of different
resonant circuits are compared in terms of their half-
power bandwidths (Art. 13.13).
Fig. 13.46
13.13. Half-Power Bandwidth of a Resonant-Circuit
A discussed earlier, in an R-L-C circuit, the maximum current at resonance is solely determined
by circuit resistance R (ä X = 0) but at off-resonance frequencies, the current amplitude depends on
Z (where X ≠ 0). The half-wave bandwidth of a circuit is given by the band of fequencies which lies
between two points on either side of f where current falls to I / 2. Narrower the bandwidth, higher

given by

13.17. Q-Factor of a Resonant Series Circuit
The Q-factor of an R-L-C series circuit can be defined in the following different ways.

(cid:169) Parallel AC circuit combination is as
important in power, radio and radar
application as in series AC circuits558 Electrical Technology
14.1. Solving Parallel Circuits
When impedances are joined in parallel, there are three methods available to solve such circuits:
(a) Vector or phasor Method (b) Admittance Method and (c) Vector Algebra
14.2. Vector or Phasor Method
Consider the circuits shown in Fig. 14.1. Here, two reactors A and B have been joined in parallel
across an r.m.s. supply of V volts. The voltage across two parallel branches A and B is the same, but
currents through them are different.
Fig. 14.1 Fig. 14.2
For Branch A, Z = (R2 + X2) ; I = V/Z ; cos φ = R /Z or φ = cos −1 (R /Z )
1 1 L 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Current I lags behind the applied voltage by φ (Fig. 14.2).

For Branch B, Z = (R2 + X2) ; I = V/Z ; cos φ = R /Z or φ = cos −1 (R /Z )
2 2 c 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
Current I leads V by φ (Fig. 14.2).
2 2
Resultant Current I
The resultant circuit current I is the vector sum of the branch currents I and I and can be found
1 2
by (i) using parallelogram law of vectors, as shown in Fig. 14.2. or (ii) resolving I into their X- and
2
Y-components (or active and reactive components respectively) and then by combining these compo-
nents, as shown in Fig. 14.3. Method (ii) is preferable, as it is quick and convenient.
With reference to Fig. 14.3. (a) we have
Sum of the active components of I and I
1 2
= I cos φ + I cos φ
1 1 2 2
Sum of the reactive components of I and I = I sin φ − I sin φ
1 2 2 2 1 1
If I is the resultant current and φ its phase, then its active and reactive components must be equal
to these X-and Y-components respectively [Fig. 14.3. (b)]
I cos φ = I cos φ + I cos φ and I sin φ = I sin φ − I sin φ

Fig. 14.3
14.3. Admittance Method
Admittance of a circuit is defined as the reciprocal of its impedance. Its symbol is Y.
∴ Y = 1 = I or Y = r.m.s. amperes
Z V r.m.s. volts
Its unit is Siemens (S). A circuit hav-
ing an impedance of one ohm has an ad-
mittance of one Siemens. The old unit
was mho (ohm spelled backwards).
As the impedance Z of a circuit has
two components X and R (Fig. 14.4.),
similarly, admittance Y also has two com-
ponents as shown in Fig. 14.5. The X-
component is known as conductance and
Fig. 14.4 Fig. 14.5
Y-component as susceptance.
Obviously, conductance g = Y cos φ
1 R
or g = . (from Fig. 14.4)
Z Z
∴ g* = R = R
Z2 R2 + X 2
1 X
Similarly, susceptance b = Y sin φ = , ∴ b** = X/Z2 = X/(R2 + X2) (from Fig. 14.5)
2 Z
The admittance Y = (g2 +b2) just as Z = (R2 + X2)
The unit of g, b and Y is Siemens. We will regard the capacitive susceptance as positive and
inductive susceptance as negative.
* In the special case when X = 0, then g = 1/R i.e., conductance becomes reciprocal of resistance, not
otherwise.
** Similarly, in the special case when R = 0, b = 1/X i.e., susceptance becomes reciprocal of reactance, not
otherwise.560 Electrical Technology
14.4. Application of Admittance Method
Consider the 3-branched circuit of Fig. 14.6. Total
conductance is found by merely adding the conductances
of three branches. Similarly, total susceptance is found
by algebraically adding the individual susceptances of
different branches.
Total conductance G = g + g + g .........
1 2 3
Total susceptance B = (− b ) + (− b ) + b ......
1 2 3
(algebraic sum)
∴ Total admittance Y = (G2 + B2)
Fig. 14.6
Total current I = VY ; Power factor cos φ = G/Y
14.5. Complex or Phasor Algebra
Consider the parallel circuit shown in Fig. 14.7. The two impedances, Z and Z , being in
1 2
parallel, have the same p.d. across them.

Total current I = I + I = + =V + = V (Y + Y ) = VY

where Y = total admittance = Y + Y
1 2
It should be noted that admittances are added for parallel branches, whereas for branches in
series, it is the impedances which are added. However, it is important to remember that since both
admittances and impedances are complex quantities, all additions must be in complex form. Simple
arithmetic additions must not be attempted.
Considering the two parallel branches of Fig. 14.8, we have
Y = 1 = 1 = (R 1 − jX L )

The polar form for admittance is Y = Y ∠ φº where φ is as given above.
Y = G2 + B2 ∠ tan −1 (B/G)
Total current I = VY ; I = VY and I = VY
1 1 2 2
If V = V ∠0º and Y = Y ∠ φ then I = VY = V ∠0º × Y ∠ φ = VY ∠ φ
In general, if V = V ∠ α and Y = Y ∠ β, then I = VY = V ∠ α × Y ∠ β = VY ∠ α + β
Hence, it should be noted that when vector voltage is multiplied by admittance either in complex
(rectangular) or polar form, the result is vector current in its proper phase relationship with respect to
the voltage, regardless of the axis to which the voltage may have been referred to.

(Elect. Technology, Vikram Univ, Ujjain)
Solution. Let I = 15 ∠0º ; Z = 10 + j15 = 18 ∠ 57º

Z = 6 − j8 = 10 ∠ − 53.1º

Applied voltage is given by
V = IZ = 15 ∠0º × 10.3 ∠−20.4º = 154.4 ∠− 20.4º
I = V/Z = 154.5 ∠− 20.4º/18 ∠57º = 8.58 ∠− 77.4º

I = V/Z = 154.5 ∠−20.4º/10 ∠−53.1º

Fig. 14.9
We could also find branch currents as under :
I = I. Z /(Z + Z ) and I = I.Z /(Z + Z )
1 2 1 2 2 1 1 2
It is seen from phasor diagram of Fig. 14.9 that I lags behind V by (77.4º − 20.4º) = 57º and I
1 2
leads it by (32.7º + 20.4º) = 53.1º.
∴ P = I2 R = 8.582 × 10 = 736 W; p.f. = cos 57º = 0.544 (lag)
1 1 1
P = I2 R = 15.452 × 6 = 1432 W ; p.f. = cos 53.1º = 0.6

Combined p.f. = cos 20.4º = 0.937 (lead)
Example 14.2. Two impedance Z = (8 + j6) and Z = (3 − j4) are in parallel. If the total
1 2
current of the combination is 25 A, find the current taken and power consumed by each impedance.
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. Z = (8 + j6) = 10 ∠36.87º ; Z = (3 − j4) = 5∠ − 53.1º

Z Z (10∠36.87º)(5∠−53.1º) 50∠−16.23º 50∠−16.23º

Let I = 25 ∠0º ; V = I Z = 25 ∠0º × 4.47 ∠−26.53º = 111.75 ∠−26.53º562 Electrical Technology
I = V/Z = 111.75 ∠−26.53º/10∠36.87º = 11.175 ∠−63.4º
1 1
I = 111.75 ∠−26.53/5 ∠−53.1º = 22.35 ∠26.57º
2
Now, the phase difference between V and I is 63.4º − 26.53º = 36.87º with current lagging.
1
Hence, cos φ = cos 36.87º = 0.8.
1
Power consumed in Z = VI cos φ = 11.175 × 111.75 × 0.8 = 990 W
1 1
Similarly, φ = 26.57 − (− 26.53) = 53.1º ; cos 53.1º = 0.6
2
Power consumed in Z = VI cos φ = 111.75 × 22.35 × 0.6 = 1499 W

Example 14.3. Refer to the circuit of Fig. 14.10 (a) and determine the resistance and reactance
of the lagging coil load and the power factor of the combination when the currents are as indicated.
(Elect. Engg. A.M.Ae. S.I.)
Solution. As seen from the Δ ABC of Fig. 14.10 (b).
5.62 = 22 + 4.52 + 2 × 2 × 4.5 × cos θ, ∴ cos θ = 0.395, sin θ = 0.919. Z = 300/4.5 = 66.67 Ω
R = Z cos θ = 66.67 × 0.919 = 61.3 Ω
p.f. = cos φ = AC/AD = (2 + 4.5 × 0.395)/5.6 = 0.67 (lag)

Example 14.4. A mercury vapour lamp unit consists of a 25μf condenser in parallel with a
series circuit containing the resistive lamp and a reactor of negligible resistance. The whole unit
takes 400 W at 240 V, 50 Hz at unity p.f. What is the voltage across the lamp ?
(F.Y. Engg. Pune Univ.)
Solution. X = 1 = 1 = 127.3 Ω, ∴ I = 240 = 1.885 A
C 2πfC 2π×50×(25×10 −6) C 127.3
W = VI cos φ = VI ∴ I = W/V = 400/240 = 1.667 A
In the vector diagram of Fig. 14.10 (b) I leads V by 90º and current I in the series circuit lags V
C 1
by φ where φ is the power factor angle of the series circuit. The vector sum of I and φ gives the
1 1 C 1
total current I. As seen tan φ = I /I = 1.885/1.667 = 1.13077. Hence, φ = 48.5º lag. The applied
1 C 1
voltage V is the vector sum of the drop across the resistive lamp which is in phase with I and drop
1
across the coil which leads I by 90º.

Voltage across the lamp = V cos Φ = 340 × cos 48.5 = 240 × 0.662 = 159 V.

Example 14.5. The currents in each branch of a two-branched parallel circuit are given by the
expression i = 7.07 sin (314t − π/4) and i = 21.2 sin (314 t + π/3)
a b
The supply voltage is given by the expression v = 354 sin 314t. Derive a similar expression for
the supply current and calculate the ohmic value of the component, assuming two pure components
in each branch. State whether the reactive components are inductive or capacitive.
(Elect. Engineering., Calcutta Univ.)
Solution. By inspection, we find that i lags the voltage by π/4 radian or 45º and i leads it by
a b
π / 3 radian or 60º. Hence, branch A consists of a resistance in series with a pure inductive reactance.
Branch B consists of a resistance in series with pure capacitive reactance as shown in Fig. 14.11 (a).Parallel A.C. Circuits 563
Maximum value of current in branch A is 7.07 A and in branch B is 21.2 A. The resultant current
can be found vectorially. As seen from vector diagram.
X-comp = 21.2 cos 60º + 7.07 cos 45º = 15.6 A
Y-comp = 21.2 sin 60º − 7.07 sin 45º = 13.36 A
Maximum value of the resultant current is = 15.62 +13.362 = 20.55 A
φ = tan −1 (13.36/15.6) = tan −1 (0.856) = 40.5º (lead)

Power Calculation
Power etc. can be calculated by the method of conjugates as explained in Ex. 14.3
Branch A
The current conjugate of (10 + j 0) is (10 − j 0)
∴ VIA = (120 + j 160) (10 − j 0) = 1200 + j 1600 ∴ kW = 1200/1000 = 1.2
∴ kVAR = 1600/1000 = 1.6. The fact that it is positive merely shows the reactive
volt-amperes are due to a lagging current* kVA = (1.22 +1.62) =2
Branch B
The current conjugate of (− 4.0 + j8) is (− 4.0 − j8)
∴ VI = (120 + j160) (− 4 − j8) = 800 − j1600
B
∴ kW = 800/1000 = 0.8 ∴ kVAR = − 1600/1000 = −−−−− 1.6
The negative sign merely indicates that reactive volt-amperes are due to the leading current
∴ kVA = [0.82 +(−1.6)2] = 1.788

purely reactive (inductive or capacitive) circuit is added as the fourth parallel branch to the above
three-branched parallel circuit so as to draw minimum current from the source. Determine the value

6+ j8 8− j6 10+ j0
Current taken would be minimum when net susceptance is zero. Since combined susceptance is
inductive, it means that we must add capacitive susceptance to neutralize it. Hence, we must connect
a pure capacitor in parallel with the above circuit such that its susceptance equals + j0.02 S
∴ I/X = 0.02 or 2π/C = 0.02 ; C = 0.2/314 = 63.7 μF

Admittance of four parallel branches = (0.24 − j0.02) + j0.02 = 0.24 S

(ii) Z = 1/Y = 1/0.169 ∠−53.8º = 5.9 ∠ 53.8º Ω

Example 14.23. The power consumed by both branches of the circuit shown in Fig. 14.23 is
2200 W. Calculate power of each branch and the reading of the ammeter.
Solution. I = V/Z
1 1
= V/(6 + j 8) = V/10 ∠53.1º, I = V/Z = V/20
2 2
∴ I /I = 20/10 = 2, P = I2 R and P = I2 R
1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2
( )
∴ P 1 = I 1 2R 1 = 22× 6 = 6
P I2R 20 5
2 2 2
Now, P = P + P or P = P 1 +1= 6+1=11 Fig. 14.25

P P 5 5
2 2
or P = 2200× 5 =1000W ∴ P = 2200 − 1000 = 1200 W
2 11 1
Since P = I2 R or 1200 = I2 × 6 ; I = 14.14 A
1 1 1 1 1
If V = V ∠0º, then I = 14.14 ∠−53.1º = 8.48 − j11.31
1
Similarly, P = I2 R or 1000 = I2 × 20 ; I = 7.07 A or I = 7.07 ∠0º
2 2 2 2 2 2
Total current I = I + I = (8.48 − j11.31) + 7.07 = 15.55 − j11.31 = 19.3 ∠−36º

Hence, ammeter reads 19.3 A
Example 14.24. Consider an electric circuit shown in Figure 14.25 (a)

Determine : (i) the current and power consumed in each branch.
(ii) the supply current and power factor. (U.P. Technical University, 2001)
Solution. Indicating branch numbers 1, 2, 3 as marked on the figure, and representing the source
voltage by 100 ∠45º,
Z = 10 + j 0 = 10∠0º, I = 100∠45º/10∠0º = 10∠45º amp
1 1
Z = 5+ j5 3 = 10∠60º, I = 100∠45º/10∠60º = 10 ∠−15º amp
2 2
Z = 5− j5 3 = 10 ∠− 60º, I = 100∠45º/10∠−60º = 10∠105º amp
3 3
Phasor addition of these three currents gives the sup-
ply current, I which comes out to be I = 20 ∠ 45º amp.
This is in phase with the supply voltage.
(i) Power consumed by the branches :
Branch 1 : 102 × 10 = 1000 watts
Branch 2 : 102 × 5 = 500 watts
Branch 3 : 102 × 5 = 500 watts
Total power consumed = 2000 watts
(ii) Power factor = 1.0 since V and I are in phase

Hence, if the circuit consists of a resistance and inductive reactance in series, then resistance is
12 ΩΩΩΩΩ and inductive reactance is 16 Ω as shown in Fig. 14.30.
(b) Conductance = 0.03 mho ∴ Resistance = 1/0.03 = 33.3 Ω
Susceptance (inductive) = 0.04 S ∴ Inductive reactance = 1/0.04 = 25 Ω
Hence, if the circuit consists of a resistance connected in parallel with an inductive reactance,
then resistance is 33.3 ΩΩΩΩΩ and inductive reactance is 25 ΩΩΩΩΩ as shown in Fig. 14.31.

paralllel. (Elect. Engg.-I, Sardar Patel Univ.)
Solution. Series Combination
Z = 115/0.8 = 143.7 Ω ; cos φ = R/Z = 0.3 ∴ R = 0.3 × 143.7 = 43.1 ΩΩΩΩΩ
Now X = Z2 −R2 = 143.72 −43.12 = 137.1 Ω

∴ L = 137.1/2π × 50 = 0.436 H
Parallel Combination
Active component of current (drawn by resistance)

Quadrature component of current (drawn by inductance) = 0.8 sin φ = 0.8 1−0.32 = 0.763 A
∴ X = 115/0.763 Ω ∴ L = 115/0.763 × 2π × 50 = 0.48 H

(Elect. Technology, Sumbal Univ.)
Solution. The circuit is shown in Fig. 14.32.
Resistance = 250/50 = 5 Ω ; Reactance = 250/25 = 10 Ω576 Electrical Technology
∴ Conductance g = 1/5 = 0.2 S, Susceptance b = − 1/10 = − 0.1 S
Admittance Y = g2 +b 2 = 0.22 +(−0.1)2 = 0.05 = 0.224 S
Y = 0.2 − j 0.1 = 0.224 ∠−26º34′ . Obviously, the total current

Example 14.37. A fluorescent lamp taking 80 W at 0.7 power factor lagging from a 230-V 50-
Hz supply is to be corrected to unity power factor. Determine the value of the correcting apparatus
required.
Solution. Power taken by the 80-W lamp circuit can be found from the following equation,
230 × I × 0.7 = 80 ∴I = 80/230 × 0.7 = 0.5 A
Reactive component of the lamp current is = I sin φ = 0.5 1 0.72 0.357A
The power factor of the lamp circuit may be raised to unity by connecting a suitable capacitor
across the lamp circuit. The leading reactive current drawn by it should be just equal to 0.357 A. In
that case, the two will cancel out leaving only the in-phase component of the lamp current.

kW having 85% efficiency and operating at 0.8 power factor. Calculate the values 0.9 lagging and
(b) 0.9 leading. For each case, sketch a vector diagram and find the value of the supply current.
Solution. Total motor power input = 4 × 3730/0.85 = 17,550 W
Motor current I = 17,550/240 × 0.8 = 91.3A

Solution. Since it is more convenient to adopt the tabular method for such questions, we will use
the same as illustrated below. We will tabulate the kW, kVA and kVAR (whether leading or lagging)
of each load. The lagging kVAR will be taken as negative and leading kVAR as positive.

14.9. Resonance in Parallel Circuits
We will consider the practical case of a coil in parallel with a capacitor, as shown in Fig. 14.48.
Such a circuit is said to be in electrical resonance when the reactive (or wattless) component of line
current becomes zero. The frequency at which
this happens is known as resonant frequency.
The vector diagram for this circuit is shown
in Fig. 14.48 (b).
Net reactive or wattless component

C L L
As at resonance, its value is zero, hence
I − I sin φ = 0 or I sin φ = I
C L L L L C
Now, I = V/Z; sin φ = X and I = V/X

Current at Resonance
As shown in Fig. 14.41 (b), since wattless component of the current is zero, the circuit current is
I = I cos φ = V . R or I = VR .
L L Z Z Z2
Putting the value of Z2 = L/C from (i) above, we get I = VR = V
L/C L/CR
The denominator L/CR is known as the equivalent or dynamic impedance of the parallel circuit
at resonance. It should be noted that impedance is ‘resistive’ only. Since current is minimum at
resonance, L/CR must, therefore, represent the maximum impedance of the circuit. In fact, parallel
resonance is a condition of maximum impedance
or minimum admittance.
Current at resonance is minimum, hence such a
circuit (when used in radio work) is sometimes
known as rejector circuit because it rejects (or takes
minimum current of) that frequency to which it reso-
nates. This resonance is often referred to as cur-
rent resonance also because the current circulating
between the two branches is many times greater than
the line current taken from the supply.
The phenomenon of parallel resonance is of great
practical importance because it forms the basis of
tuned circuits in Electronics.
Fig. 14.49 The variations of impedance and current with
frequency are shown in Fig. 14.49. As seen, at resonant frequency, impedance is maximum and
equals L/CR. Consequently, current at resonance is minimum and is = V / (L/CR). At off-resonance
frequencies, impedance decreases and, as a result, current increases as shown.

Talking in terms of susceptance, the above relations can be put as under :
X 1
Inductive susceptance B = L ; capacitive susceptance B =
L R2 X L 2 C X C
Net susceptance B = (B − B ) ∴ Y = G + j (B − B ) = G + jB.
C L C L
The parallel circuit is said to be in resonance when B = 0.
∴ B − B = 0 or 1 = X L
C L X R2 + X2
C L
The rest procedure is the same as above. It may be noted that at resonance, the admittance equals
the conductance.
14.10. Graphic Representation of Parallel Resonance
We will now discuss the effect of variation of
frequency on the susceptance of the two parallel
branches. The variations are shown in Fig. 14.50.
(i) Inductive susceptance ;
b = − 1/X = − 1/2πf L
L
It is inversely proportional to the frequency of
the applied voltage. Hence, it is represented by a
rectangular hyperbola drawn in the fourth quadrant
(∴ it is assumed negative).
(ii) Capacitive susceptance ;
b = 1/X = ωC = 2πf C
C
It increases with increase in the frequency of the
applied voltage. Hence, it is represented by a straight
line drawn in the first quadrant (it is assumed positive).
(iii) Net Susceptance B
It is the difference of the two susceptances and is
represented by the dotted hyperbola. At point A, net Fig. 14.50
susceptance is zero, hence admittance is minimum (and equal to G). So at point A, line current is
minimum.
Obviously, below resonant frequency (corresponding to point A), inductive susceptance pre-
dominates, hence line current lags behind the applied voltage. But for frequencies above the resonant
frequency, capacitive susceptance predominates, hence line current leads.3
14.11. Points to Remember
Following points about parallel resonance should be noted and compared with those about series
resonance. At resonance.
1. net susceptance is zero i.e. 1/X = X /Z2 or X × X = Z2 or L/C = Z2
C L L C
2. the admittance equals conductance
3. reactive or wattless component of line current is zero.
4. dynamic impedance = L/CR ohm.Parallel A.C. Circuits 591

5. line current at resonance is minimum and = but is in phase with the applied voltage.

6. power factor of the circuit is unity.
14.12. Bandwidth of a Parallel Resonant Circuit
The bandwidth of a parallel circuit is defined in the same way as that for a series circuit. This
circuit also has upper and lower half-power frequencies where power dissipated is half of that at
resonant frequency.
At bandwidth frequencies, the net susceptance B equals the conductance. Hence, at f ,

B = B − B = G. At f , B = B − B = G. Hence, Y = G2 + B2 = 2.G and φ = tan −1 (B/G) =

14.13. Q-factor of a Parallel Circuit
It is defined as the ratio of the current circulating between its two branches to the line current
drawn from the supply or simply, as the current magnification. As seen from Fig. 14.51, the
circulating current between capacitor and coil branches is I .

15.1. Introduction
We have already discussed various d.c. network theorems in Chapter
2 of this book. The same laws are applicable to a.c. networks except that
instead of resistances, we have impedances and instead of taking algebraic
sum of voltages and currents we have to take the phasor sum.
15.2. Kirchhoff’s Laws
The statements of Kirchhoff’s laws are similar to those given in Art.
2.2 for d.c. networks except that instead of algebraic sum of currents and
voltages, we take phasor or vector sums for a.c. networks. Gustav Kirchhoff
1. Kirchhoff’s Current Law. According to this law, in any electri- (1824-1887)
cal network, the phasor sum of the currents meeting at a junction is zero.
In other words, ∑ I = 0 ...at a junction
Put in another way, it simply means that in any electri-
cal circuit the phasor sum of the currents flowing towards a
junction is equal to the phasor sum of the currents going
away from that junction.
2. Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. According to this law,
the phasor sum of the voltage drops across each of the con-
ductors in any closed path (or mesh) in a network plus the
phasor sum of the e.m.fs. connected in that path is zero.
In other words, ∑ IR + ∑ e.m.f. = 0 ...round a mesh
Example 15.1. Use Kirchhoff’s laws to find the
current flowing in each branch of the network shown in
Fig. 15.1.
Solution. Let the current distribution be as shown in
Fig. 15.1 (b). Starting from point A and applying KVL to
closed loop ABEFA, we get
−10(x + y) − 20 x + 100 = 0 or 3x + y = 10 ...(i)
Fig. 15.1
Similarly, considering the closed loop BCDEB and starting from point B, we have
−50 ∠90º + 5y + 10 (x + y) =0 or 2x + 3y = j10 ...(ii)
Multiplying Eq. (i) by 3 and subtracting it from Eq. (ii), we get
7x = 30 − j10 or x = 4.3 − j1.4 = 4.52 ∠−18ºA.C. Network Analysis 601
Substituting this value of x in Eq. (i), we have
y = 10 − 3x = 5.95 ∠ 119.15º = − 2.9 + j5.2
∴ x + y = 4.3 − j1.4 − 2.9 + j5.2 = 1.4 + j3.8

It has already been discussed in Art. 2.3. Sign convention regarding the voltage drops across
various impedances and the e.m.f.s is the same as explained in Art. 2.3. The circuits may be solved
with the help of KVL or by use of determinants and Cramer’s rule or with the help of impedance
matrix [Z ].

Example 15.2. Find the power output of the voltage source in the circuit of Fig. 15.4. Prove
that this power equals the power in the circuit resistors.
Solution. Starting from point A in the clockwise direction and applying KVL to the mesh ABEFA,
we get.

1 1 2
or I (8 − j6) + I . (j6) = 100 ∠ 0º ...(i)

Similarly, starting from point B and applying KVL to

or I (j6) + I (3 − j2) = 0 ...(ii)

Example 15.3. Using Maxwell’s loop current method, find the value of current in each branch
of the network shown in Fig. 15.5 (a).
Solution. Let the currents in the two loops be I and I flowing in the clockwise direction as
1 2
shown in Fig. 15.5 (b). Applying KVL to the two loops, we get
Loop No. 1
25 − I (40 + j50) − (−j 100) (1 − I ) = 0
1 1 2
∴ 25 − I (40 − j50) − j 100 I = 0 ...(i)
1 2
Loop No. 2

∴ −j100 I − I (60 −j100) = 0

∴ I = 1 = 1 = 0.8575∠31ºI ...(ii)

Fig. 15.5
Substituting this value of I in (i) above, we get 25 − I (40 − j50) − j100 × 0.8575 ∠31º I = 0
2 1 1
or 25 − 40 I + j50 I − 85.75 ∠59º I = 0 (j100 = 100 ∠ 90º)
1 1 1
or 25 − I (84.16 + j 23.5) = 0.

∴ I = 25 = 25 0.286 ∠−15.6º A

Also, I = 0.8575 ∠− 31º I × 0.286 ∠− 15.6º = 0.2452 ∠− 46.6ºA
2 1
Current through the capacitor = (I −I ) = 0.286 ∠− 15.6º − 0.2452 ∠46.6º = 0.107 + j0.1013 =

Example 15.4. Write the three mesh current
equations for network shown in Fig. 15.6.
Solution. While moving along I , if we apply
1
KVL, we get
−(−j10) I −10(I − I )−5 (I − I ) = 0
1 1 2 1 3
or I (15 −j10) − 10 I − 5I = 0 ...(i)
1 2 3
In the second loop, current through the a.c.
source is flowing upwards indicating that its upper
end is positive and lower is negative. As we move
along I , we go from the positive terminal of the
2
voltage source to its negative terminal. Hence, we Fig. 15.6A.C. Network Analysis 603
experience a decrease in voltage which as per Art. would be taken as negative.
−j5 I − 10 ∠30º − 8(I − I ) − 10 (I − I ) = 0
2 2 3 2 1
or 10 I − I (18 + j5) + 8 I = 10 ∠ 30º ...(ii)
1 2 3
Similarly, from third loop, we get
−20 ∠0º − 5(I − I ) − 8 (I − I ) − I (3 + j4) = 0
3 1 3 2 3
or 5 I + 8 I − I (16 + j4) = 20 ∠0º ...(iii)
1 2 3
The values of the three currents may be calculated with the help of Cramer’s rule. However, the
same values may be found with the help of mesh impedance [Z ] whose different items are as under:
m
Z = − j 10 + 10 + 5 = (15 − j10); Z = (18 + j5)
11 22
Z = (16 + j5); Z = Z = − 10; Z = Z = −8
33 12 21 23 32
Z = Z = − 5; E = 0; E = −10 ∠30º; E = − 20 ∠0º
13 31 1 2 3
Hence, the mesh equations for the three currents in the matrix form are as given below :
⎡(15− j10) −10 −5 ⎤ ⎡I ⎤ ⎡ 0 ⎤
⎢ −10 (18+ j5) −8 ⎥=⎢ I 1⎥=⎢−10∠30º ⎥

Example 15.5. For the circuit shown in Fig. 15.7 determine the branch voltage and currents
and power delivered by the source using mesh analysis.
(Elect. Network Analysis Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. Let the mesh currents be as shown in Fig. 15.7. The different items of the mesh
resistance matrix [E ] are :
m
Z = (2 + j1 + j2 − j1) = (2 + j2)
11
Z = (−j2 + 1 − j1 + j2) = (1 − j1)
22
Z = Z = − (j2 − j1) = −j1
12 21
Hence, the mesh equations in the matrix form
are
⎡ ⎢⎣ (2 − + j1 j2) (1 − − j1 j1) ⎤ ⎥⎦ = ⎣ ⎢ ⎡ I I 1 ⎦ ⎥ ⎤ = ⎡ ⎢⎣− 1 5 0 ∠ ∠ 3 0 0 º º ⎤ ⎥⎦

∴ Δ = (2 + j2) (1 − j1) + 1 = 5 Fig. 15.7
Δ = ⎡ 10 −j1 ⎤ = 10(1 − j1) − j1(4.43 + j2.5) = 12.5 − j 14.43 = 19.1 ∠− 49.1º

I = Δ /Δ = 19.1 ∠− 49.1º/5 = 3.82 ∠−49.1º = 2.5 – j2.89
1 1
I = Δ /Δ = 5.46 ∠− 135º/5 = 1.1 ∠−135º = − 0.78 − j0.78
2 2
Current through branch BC = I −I = 2.5 −j2.89 + 0.78 + j0.78 = 3.28 − j2.11 = 3.49 ∠− 32.75º
1 2
Drop over branch AB = (2 + j1)(2.5 − j 2.89) = 7.89 − j 3.28
Drop over branch BD = (1 − j2) (−0.78 − j0.78) = 2.34 + j0.78
Drop over branch BC = j (I − I ) = j1 (3.28 − j2.11) = 2.11 + j3.28
1 1 2
Power delivered by the sources would be found by using conjugate method. Using current
conjugate, we get604 Electrical Technology
VA = 10(2.5 + j2.89) = 25 + j28.9 ; ∴W = 25 W
1 1
VA = V × I — because –I is the current coming out of the second voltage source. Again, using
2 2 2 2
current conjugate, we have
VA = (4.43 + j2.5) (0.78 − j0.78) or W = 4.43 × 0.78 + 2.5 × 0.78 = 5.4 W
2 2
∴ total power supplied by the two sources = 25 + 5.4 = 30.4 W
Incidentally, the above fact can be verified by adding up the powers dissipated in the three branches
of the circuit. It may be noted that there is no power dissipation in the branch BC.
Power dissipated in branch AB = 3.822 × 2 = 29.2 W
Power dissipated in branch BD = 1.12 × 1 = 1.21 W
Total power dissipated = 29.2 + 1.21 = 30.41 W.

Solution. In the given circuit, there are no principle nodes. However, if we take point B as the

second voltage source is flowing away from node 1, it
would be taken as negative. Hence, the term contain-
ing this source will become positive because it has been

15.5. Superposition Theorem
As applicable to a.c. networks, it states as follows :
In any network made up of linear impedances and containing more than one source of e.m.f., the
current flowing in any branch is the phasor sum of the currents that would flow in that branch if each
source were considered separately, all other e.m.f. sources being replaced for the time being, by their
respective internal impedances (if any).
Note. It may be noted that independent sources can be ‘killed’ i.e. removed leaving behind their internal
impedances (if any) but dependent sources should not be killed.
Example 15.12. Use
Superposition theorem to
find the voltage V in the

15.6. Thevenin’s Theorem

th th L th
open-circuit voltage across A and B and Z is the internal impedance of the

network as viewed from the open-circuited terminals A and B with all volt-
age sources replaced by their internal impedances (if any) and current sources
by infinite impedance.

15.7. Reciprocity Theorem
This theorem applies to networks containing linear bilateral elements and a single voltage source
or a single current source. This theorem may be stated as follows :
If a voltage source in branch A of a network causes a current of 1 branch B, then shifting the
voltage source (but not its impedance) of branch B will cause the same current I in branch A.
It may be noted that currents in other branches will generally not remain the same. A simple way
of stating the above theorem is that if an ideal voltage source and an ideal ammeter are inter-changed,
the ammeter reading would remain the same. The ratio of the input voltage in branch A to the output
current in branch B is called the transfer impedance.
Similarly, if a current source between nodes 1 and 2 causes a potential difference of V between
nodes 3 and 4, shifting the current source (but not its admittance) to nodes 3 and 4 causes the same
voltage V between nodes 1 and 2.
In other words, the interchange of an ideal current source and an ideal voltmeter in any linear
bilateral network does not change the voltmeter reading.
However, the voltages between other nodes would generally not remain the same. The ratio of
the input current between one set of nodes to output voltage between another set of nodes is called the
transfer admittance.
Example 15.18. Verify Reciprocity theorem for V & I in the circuit shown in Fig. 15.48.
[Elect. Network Analysis, Nagpur Univ. 1993]
Solution. We will find the value of the current I as read by the ammeter first by applying series
parallel circuits technique and then by using mesh resistance matrix (Art.)
1. Series Parallel Circuit Technique
The total impedance as seen by the voltage source is
j1(2− j1)
= 1 + [j 1 | | (2 − j 1)] = 1 + = 15 + j 1
2
∴ total circuit current i =
5∠0º
1.5+ j1
This current gets divided into two parts at point A, one part going through the ammeter and the
other going along AB. By using current-divider rule. (Art), we have
I = 5 × J1 = j5
1.5+ j1 (2+ j1−j1) 3+j2
2. Mesh Resistance Matrix
In Fig. 15.48 (b), R = (1 + j1), R = (2 + j1 − j1) = 2; R = R = − j1
11 22 12 21
∴ (1 − + j1 j1) − 2 j1 I I 1 = I 5 0 ; Δ = 2(1+ j 1) − (−j 1) (−j 1) = 3 + j 2
2
Δ 2 = (1 − + j j 1 1) 5 0 = 0 + j 5 = j 5 ; I 2 = I = Δ Δ 2 = (3+ j5 j2)
As shown in Fig. 15.48 (c), the voltage source has been interchanged with the ammeter. The
polarity of the voltage source should be noted in particular. It looks as if the voltage source has been
pushed along the wire in the counterclockwise direction to its new position, thus giving the voltage
polarity as shown in the figure. We will find the value of I in the new position of the ammeter by using
the same two techniques as above.A.C. Network Analysis 619

15.8. Norton’s Theorem
As applied to a.c. networks, this theorem can be stated as under :
Any two terminal active linear network containing voltage sources and impedances when viewed
from its output terminals is equivalent to a constant current source and a parallel impedance. The
constant current is equal to the current which would flow in a short-circuit placed across the terminals
and the parallel impedance is the impedance of the network when viewed from open-circuited termi-
nals after voltage sources have been replaced by their internal impedances (if any) and current sources
by infinite impedance.
Example 15.19. Find the Norton’s equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 15.50. Also find the
current which will flow through an impedance of (10 − j 20) Ω across the terminals A and B.
Solution. As shown in Fig. 15.50 (b), the terminals A and B have been short-cicuited.
∴ I = I = 25/(10 + j 20) = 25/22.36 ∠63.4º = 1.118 ∠−63.4º
SC N
When voltage source is replaced by a short, then the internal resistance of the circuit, as viewed
from open terminals A and B, is R = (10 + j20)Ω. Hence, Norton’s equivalent circuit becomes as
N
shown in Fig. 15.50(c).
Fig. 15.50
When the load impedance of (10 − j20) is applied across the terminals A and B, current through it can
be found with the help of current-divider rule.
(10+ j20)
∴ I = 1.118 ∠−63.4º × = 1.25 A
L (10+ j20)+(10−j20)
Example 15.20. Use Norton’s theorem to find current in the load connected across terminals A
and B of the circuit shown in Fig. 15.51 (a).
Solution. The first step is to short-circuit terminals A and B as shown in Fig. 15.51 (a)*. The
short across A and B not only short-circuits the load but the (10 + j 10) impedance as well.
I = 100 ∠0º/(−j 10) = j 10 = 10 ∠90º
N
Since the impedance of the Norton and Thevenin equivalent circuits is the same, Z = 10−j10.
N
Fig. 15.51
* For finding I , we may or may not remove the load from the terminals (because, in either case, it would be
N
short-circuited) but for finding R , it has to be removed as in the case of Thevenin’s theorem.
NA.C. Network Analysis 621
The Norton’s equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 15.51 (b). In Fig. 15.51 (c), the load has been
reconnected across the terminals A and B. Since the two impedances are equal, current through each
is half of the total current i.e. 10∠90º/2 = 5 ∠90º.

15.9. Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
As explained earlier in Art. this theorem is particularly useful for analysing communication
networks where the goals is transfer of maximum power between two circuits and not highest
efficiency.622 Electrical Technology
15.10. Maximum Power Transfer Theorems - General Case
We will consider the following maximum power transfer theorems when the source has a fixed
complex impedance and delivers power to a load consisting of a variable resistance or a variable
complex impedance.
Case 1. When load consists only for a variable resistance R [Fig. 15.57 (a)]. The circuit current
L
is
V
g
I =
(R +R )2+X2
g L g
V2R
Power delivered to R is P = g L
L L (R + R )2 + X2
g L g
To determine the value of R for maximum transfer of power, we should set the first derivative
L
dP /dR to zero.
L L
dP L = d ⎡ ⎢ V g 2R L ⎤ ⎥=V2 ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ [(R g + R L )2+X g 2]−R L (2)(Rg+R L ) ⎫ ⎪ ⎬=0
dR L dR L ⎣ ⎢(R g + R L )2 + X g 2 ⎦ ⎥ g ⎩⎪ [(R g +R L )2+X g 2]2 ⎭⎪
or R2 +2R R +R2 + X2−2R R −2R2 =0 and R2 + X2 =R2
g g L L g L g L g g L
∴ R = R2+X2 = | Z |
L g g g
It means that with a variable pure resistive load, maximum power is delivered across the termi-
nals of an active network only when the load resistance is equal to the absolute value of the imped-
ance of the active network. Such a match is called magnitude match.
Moreover, if X is zero, then for maximum power transfer R = R
g L g
Case 2. Load impedance having both variable resistance and variable reactance [Fig. 15.57 (b)].
V
The circuit current is I = g
(R +R )2 +(X + X )2
g L g L
Fig. 15.57
V2R
The power delivered to the load is = P = I2R = g L
L L (R +R )2 +(X + X )2
g L g L
V2R
Now, if R is held fixed, P is maximum when X = − X . In that case P = g L
L L g L L max (R +R )2
g L
If on the other hand, R is variable then, as in Case 1 above, maximum power is delivered to the
L
load when R = R . In that case if R = R and X = − X , then Z = Z . Such a match is called
L g L g L g L g
conjugate match.A.C. Network Analysis 623
From the above, we come to the conclusion that in the case of a load impedance having both
variable resistance and variable reactance, maximum power transfer across the terminals of the ac-
tive network occurs when Z equals the complex conjugate of the network impedance Z i.e. the two
L g
impedances are conjugately matched.
Case 3. Z with variable resistance and fixed reactance [Fig. 15.57 (c)]. The equations for
L
current I and power P are the same as in Case 2 above except that we will consider X to remain
L L
constant. When the first derivative of P with respect to R is set equal to zero, it is found that
L L
R 2 = R 2 + (X + X )2 and R = | Z + jZ |
L g g L L g L
Since Z and X are both fixed quantities, these can be combined into a single impedance. Then
g L
with R variable, Case 3 is reduced to Case 1 and the maximum power transfer takes place when R
L L
equals the absolute value of the network impedance.
Summary
The above facts can be summarized as under :
1. When load is purely resistive and adjustable, MPT is achieved when R = | Z | = R2 + X2 .
L g g g
2. When both load and source impedances are purely resistive (i.e. X = X = 0), MPT is
L g
achieved when R = R .
L g
3. When R and X are both independently adjustable, MPT is achieved when X = − X and R
L L L g L
= R .

4. When X is fixed and R is adjustable, MPT is achieved when R = [R2 +(X + X )2]

Example 15.21. In the circuit of Fig. 15.58, which load impedance of p.f. = 0.8 lagging when
connected across terminals A and B will draw the maximum power from the source. Also find the
power developed in the load and the power loss in the source.
Solution. For maximum power transfer | Z | = | Z | (32+52) = 5.83 Ω.
L 1
For p.f. = 0.8, cos φ = 0.8 and sin φ = 0.6.
∴ R = Z cos φ = 5.83 × 0.8 = 4.66 Ω.
L L
X = Z sin φ = 5.83 × 0.6 = 3.5 Ω.
L L
Total circuit impedance Z = [(R +R )2 +(X +X )2]

galvanometer is replaced by a vibration galvanometer (for commercial frequencies or by telephone
detector if frequencies are higher (500 to 2000 Hz)).
Fig. 16.1
The condition for balance is the same as before but instead of resistances, impedances are
used i.e.
Z /Z =Z /Z or Z Z =Z Z
1 2 4 3 1 3 2 4
But there is one important difference i.e. not only should there be balance for the magnitudes
of the impedances but also a phase balance. Writing the impedances in their polar form, the above
condition becomes
Z ∠φ .Z ∠φ =Z ∠φ .Z ∠φ or Z Z ∠φ +φ =Z Z ∠φ +φ
1 1 3 3 2 2 4 4 1 3 1 3 2 4 2 4
Hence, we see that, in fact, there are two balance conditions which must be satisfied
simultaneously in a four-arm a.c. impedance bridge.
(i) Z Z =Z Z ... for magnitude balance
1 3 2 4
(ii) φ +φ =φ +φ ... for phase angle balance
1 3 2 4
In this chapter, we will consider a few of the numerous bridge circuits used for the
measurement of self-inductance, capacitance and mutual inductance, choosing as examples some
bridges which are more common.
16.2. Maxwell’s Inductance Bridge
The bridge circuit is used for medium inductances and can be arranged to yield results of
considerable precision. As shown in Fig. 16.2, in the two arms, there are two pure resistances so
* Products of opposite arm resistances are equal.A.C. Bridges 629
that for balance relations, the phase balance depends onthe remaining two arms. If a coil of an
unknown impedanceZ is placed in one arm, then its positive phase angle φ can be compensated
1 1
for in either of the following two ways:
(i) A known impedance with an equal positive phase angle
may be used in either of the adjacent arms (so that φ = or
1 3 2
= φ ), remaining two arms have zero phase angles (being pure
4
resistances). Such a network is known as Maxwell’s a.c. bridge or
L /L bridge.
1 4
(ii) Or an impedance
with an equal negative
phase angle (i.e.
capacitance) may be used
in opposite arm (so that
φ +φ = 0). Such a
1 3
network is known as
Maxwell-Wien bridge
James Clark Maxwell (Fig. 16.5) or Maxwell’s
L/C bridge.
Hence, we conclude that an inductive impedance
may be measured in terms of another inductive
impedance (of equal time constant) in either adjacent
arm (Maxwell bridge) or the unknown inductive
impedance may be measured in terms of a combination
of resistance and capacitance (of equal time constant) in Fig. 16.2
the opposite arm (Maxwell-Wien bridge). It is important,
however, that in each case the time constants of the two
impedances must be matched.
As shown in Fig. 16.2,
Z =R + jX =R + jωL ... unknown; Z = R + jX =R + jωL ...known
1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4
R , R = known pure resistances; D = detector
2 3
The inductance L is a variable self-inductance of constant resistance, its inductance being of
4
the same order as L . The bridge is balanced by varying L and one of the resistances R or R .
1 4 2 3
Alternatively, R and R can be kept constant and the resistance
2 3
of one of the other two arms can be varied by connecting an
additional resistance in that arm (Ex. 16.1).
The balance condition is that Z Z = Z Z
1 3 2 4
∴ (R + jωL )R =(R + jωL )R
1 1 3 4 4 2
Equating the real and imaginary parts on both sides, we
have
RR =R R or R /R =R /R *

(i.e. products of the resistances of opposite arms are equal).

Hence, the unknown self-inductance can be measured in terms of the known inductance L
4
and the two resistors. Resistive and reactive terms balance independently and the conditions are
independent of frequency. This bridge is often used for measuring the iron losses of the
transformers at audio frequency.
The balance condition is shown vectorially in Fig. 16.3. The currents I and I are in phase
4 3
with I and I . This is, obviously, brought about by adjusting the impedances of different branches,
1 2
so that these currents lag behind the applied voltage V by the same amount. At balance, the voltage
drop V across branch 1 is equal to that across branch 4 and I = I . Similarly, voltage drop V
1 3 4 2
across branch 2 is equal to that across branch 3 and I = I .

Example 16.1. The arms of an a.c. Maxwell bridge are arranged as follows: AB and BC are
non-reactive resistors of 100 Ω each, DA is a standard
variable reactor L of resistance 32.7Ω and CD
1
comprises a standard variable resistor R in series with a
coil of unknown impedance. Balance was obtained with
L = 47.8 mH and R = 1.36Ω. Find the resistance and
1
inductance of the coil.
(Elect. Inst. & Meas. Nagpur Univ. 1993)
Solution. The a.c. bridge is shown in Fig. 16.4.
Since the products of the resistances of opposite
arms are equal
∴ 32.7×100=(1.36+R )100
4
∴ 32.7 = 1.36+R orR =32.7−1.36= 31.34ΩΩΩΩΩ
4 4
Since L ×100=L ×100 ∴ L = L = 47.8 mH
1 4 4 1
or because time constants are the same, hence
Fig. 16.4 L /32.7 = L /(31.34 + 1.36) ∴ L = 47.8 mH

16.3. Maxwell-Wien Bridge or Maxwell’s L/C Bridge
As referred to in Art. 16.2, the positive phase angle of
an inductive impedance may be compensated by the
negative phase angle of a capacitive impedance put in the
opposite arm. The unknown inductance then becomes
known in terms of this capacitance.
Let us first find the combined impedance of arm 1.

Example 16.2. The arms of an a.c. Maxwell bridge are arranged as follows: AB is a non-
inductive resistance of 1,000 Ω in parallel with a capacitor of capacitance 0.5 μF, BC is a
non-inductive resistance of 600Ω CD is an inductive impedance (unknown) and DA is a non-
inductive resistance of 400Ω. If balance is obtained under these conditions, find the value of the
resistance and the inductance of the branch CD.

Solution. The bridge is shown in Fig. 16.6. The
conditions of balance have already been derived in Art.

16.4. Anderson Bridge Fig. 16.6
It is a very important and useful modification of the Maxwell-Wien bridge described in Art.
16.3. In this method, the unknown inductance is measured in terms of a known capacitance and
resistance, as shown in Fig. 16.7.

The balance conditions for this bridge may be easily obtained by converting the mesh of
impedances C, R and R to an equivalent star with star point O by Δ/Y transformation. As seen

This method is capable of precise measurements of inductances over a wide range of values
from a few micro-henrys to several henrys and is one of the commonest and the best
bridgemethods.
Example 16.3. An alternating current bridge is arranged as follows: The arms AB and BC
consists of non-inductive resistances of 100-ohm each, the arms BE and CD of non-inductive
variable resistances, the arm EC of a capacitor of 1 μF capacitance, the arm DA of an inductive
resistance. The alternating current source is connected to A and C and the telephone receiver to
E and D. A balance is obtained when resistances of arms CD and BE are 50 and 2,500 ohm
respectively. Calculate the resistance and inductance of arm DA.
Draw the vector diagram showing voltage at every point of the network.
(Elect. Measurements, Pune Univ.)
Solution. The circuit diagram and voltage vector diagram are shown in Fig. 16.8. As seen, I

It is also a modification of the Maxwell-Wien bridge and is particularly useful if the phase
angle of the inductive impedance tan 1( L/R) is large. The network is shown in Fig. 16.10.

It is seen that, in this case, a comparatively smaller series resistance R is used instead of a parallel

resistance (which has to be of a very large value).

The symmetry of expressions should help the readers to remember the results even when
branch elements are exchanged, as in Ex. 16.5.
Example 16.5. The four arms of a Hay’s a.c. bridge are arranged as follows: AB is a coil of
unknown impedance; BC is a non-reactive resistor of 1000 Ω; CD is a non-reactive resistor of
833 Ω in series with a standard capacitor of 0.38 μF; DA is a non-reactive resistor of
16,800 Ω. If the supply frequency is 50 Hz, determine the inductance and the resistance at the
balance condition. (Elect. Measu. A.M.I.E. Sec B, 1992)

The arrangement of this bridge is shown in Fig. 16.12. In this method, also, the inductance is
determined in terms of resistance and capacitance. This method has, however, the advantage of
being useful over a very wide range of inductances with capacitors of reasonable dimensions.

Since ωdoes not appear in the final balance equations, hence the bridge is unaffected by
frequency variations and wave-form.
16.7. Heavisible-Campbell Equal Ratio
Bridge
It is a mutual inductance bridge and is used for
measuring self-inductance over a wide range in terms of
mutual inductometer readings. The connections for
Heaviside’s bridge employing a standard variable mutual
inductance are shown in Fig. 16.13. The primary of the
mutual inductometer is inserted in the supply circuit and
the secondary having self-inductance L and resistance R
2 2
is put in arm 2 of the bridge. The unknown inductive
impedance having self-inductance of L and resistance R
1 1
is placed in arm 1. The other two arms have pure
Fig. 16.13
resistances of R and R .

This bridge, as modified by Campbell, is shown in Fig. 16.14. Here R = R . A balancing coil
3 4
or a test coil of self-inductance equal to the self-inductance L of the secondary of the
2
inductometer and of resistance slightly greater than
R is connected in series with the unknown inductive
2
impedance (R and L ) in arm 1. A non-inductive
1 1
resistance box along with a constant-inductance
rheostat are also introduced in arm 2 as shown.
Balance is obtained by varying M and r. Two
readings are taken; one when Z is in circuit and
1
second when Z is removed or short-circuited across
1
its terminals.
With unknown impedance Z still in
1
circuit,suppose for balance the values of mutual
inductance and r are M and r . With Z short-
1 1 1
circuited, let these values be M and r . Then
2 2
Fig. 16.14
L = 2(M – M ) and R = r – r
1 1 2 1 1 2
By this method, the self-inductance and resistance of the leads are eliminated.
Example 16.6. The inductance of a coil is measured by using the Heaviside-Campbell equal
ratio bridge. With the test coil short-circuited, balance is obtained when adjustable non-reactive
resistance is 12.63Ω and mutual inductometer is set at 0.1 mH. When the test coil is in circuit,
balance is obtained when the adjustable resistance is 25.9 Ω and mutual inductometer is set at
15.9 mH. What is the resistance and inductance of the coil?
Solution. With reference to Art. 16.7 and Fig. 16.14, r = 25.9 Ω, M = 15.9 mH
1 1
With test coil short-circuited r = 12.63 Ω; M = 0.1 mH
2 2
L = 2 (M – M ) = 2 (15.9 – 0.1) = 31.6 mH

R =−r −r = 25.9 – 12.63 = 13.27 Ω

impossibility of obtaining a perfect balance if both the Fig. 16.15
capacitors are not free from the dielectric loss. A perfect balance can only be obtained if air
capacitors are used.
16.10. Schering Bridge
It is one of the very important and useful methods of measuring the capacitance and dielectric
loss of a capacitor. In fact, it is a device for comparing an imperfect capacitor C in terms of a loss-
2
free standard capacitor C [Fig. 16.16 (a)]. The imperfect capacitor is represented by its equivalent
1
loss-free capacitor C in series with a resistance r [Fig. 16.16 (b)].

Fig. 16.16
For high voltage applications, the voltage is applied at the junctions shown in the figure. The
junction between arms 3 and 4 is earthed. Since capacitor impedances at lower frequencies are
much higher than resistances, most of the voltage will appear across capacitors. Grounding of the
junction affords safety to the operator form the high-voltage hazards while making balancing
adjustment in arms 3 and 4.

The quality of a capacitor is usually expressed in terms of its phase defect angle or dielectric
loss angle which is defined as the angle by which current departs from exact quadrature from the
applied voltage i.e. the complement of the phase angle. If φ is the actual phase angle and δ
the defect angle, then 90 . For small values of δ, tan δ = sin
δ = cos φ (approximately). Tan δ is usually called the dissipation
factor of the R–C circuit. For low power factors, therefore, dissipation
factor is approximately equal to the power factor.

Example 16.7. In a test on a bakelite sample at 20 kV, 50 Hz by a Schering bridge, having
a standard capacitor of 106pF, balance was obtained with a capacitance of 0.35μF in parallel
with a non-inductive resistance of 318 ohms, the non-inductive resistance in the remaining arm of
the bridge being 130 ohms. Determine the capacitance, the p.f. and equivalent series resistance

(cid:169) By using various combinations of resistors,
inductors and capacitors, we can make circuits
that have the property of passing or rejecting
either low or high frequencies or bands of
frequencies642 Electrical Technology
17.1. Introduction
The reactances of inductors and capacitors depend on the frequency of the a.c. signal applied
to them. That is why these devices are known as frequency-selective. By using various
combinations of resistors, inductors and capacitors, we can make circuits that have the property of
passing or rejecting either low or high frequencies or bands of frequencies. These frequency-
selective networks, which alter the amplitude and phase characteristics of the input a.c. signal, are
called filters. Their performance is usually expressed in terms of how much attenuation a band of
frequencies experiences by passing through them. Attenuation is commonly expressed in terms of
decibels (dB).
17.2. Applications
A.C. filters find application in audio systems and
television etc. Bandpass filters are used to select
frequency ranges corresponding to desired radio or
television station channels. Similarly, bandstop filters are
used to reject undesirable signals that may contaminate
the desirable signal. For example, low-pass filters are
used to eliminate undesirable hum in d.c. power
supplies.
No loudspeaker is equally efficient over the entire
audible range of frequencies. That is why high-fidelity
loudspeaker systems use a combination of low-pass,
Closeup of a crossover network
high-pass and bandpass filters(called crossover
networks) to separate and then direct signals of appropriate frequency range tothe different
loudspeakers making up the system. Fig. 17.1 shows the output circuit of a high-fidelity audio
amplifier, which uses three filters to separate, the low, mid-range and high frequencies, for feeding
them to individual loudspeakers, best able to reproduce them.
Fig. 17.1
17.3. Different Types of Filters
A.C. filter networks are divided into two major categories: (i) active networks and (ii) passive
networks.
Active filter networks usually contain transistors and/or operational amplifiers in combination
with R, L and C elements to obtain the desired filtering effect. These will not be discussed in this
book. We will consider passive filter networks only which usually consist of series-parallel
combinations of R, L and C elements. There are four types of such networks, as described below:A.C. Filter Networks 643
1. Low-Pass Filter. As
the name shows, it allows only
low frequencies to pass
through, but attenuates (to a
lesser or greater extent) all
higher frequencies. The
maximum frequency which it
allows to pass through, is
called cutoff frequency f (also
c
called break frequency). There
are R and R low-pass filters.
L C
2. High-Pass Filter. It
allows signals with higher
Three way passive crossover network
frequencies to pass from input
to output while rejecting lower frequencies. The minimum frequency it allows to pass is called
cutoff frequency f. There are R and R high-
c L C
pass filters.
3. Bandpass Filter. It is a resonant circuit
which is tuned to pass a certain band or range
of frequencies while rejecting all frequencies
below and above this range (called passband).
4. Bandstop Filter. It is a resonant circuit
that rejects a certain band or range of
frequencies while passing all frequencies
below and above the rejected band. Such
filters are also called wavetraps, notch filters
or band-elimination, band-separation or band-
rejection filters.
High pass filter
17.4. Octaves and Decades of Frequency
A filter’s performance is expressed in terms of the number of decibels the signal is increased
or decreased per frequency octave or frequency decade. An octave means a doubling or halving of
a frequency whereas a decade means tenfold increase or decrease in frequency.
17.5. The Decibel System
These system of logarithmic measurement is widely used in audio, radio, TV and instrument
industry for comparing two voltages, currents or power levels. These levels are measured in a unit
called bel (B) or decibel (dB) which is 1/10th of a bel.
Suppose we want to compare the output power P of a filter with its input power P. The
0 i
power level change is
= 10 log th P /P dB
10 0 i
It should be noted that dB is the unit of power change (i.e. increase or decrease) and not of
power itself. Moreover, 20 dB is not twice as much power as 10 dB.
However, when voltage and current levels are required, then the expressions are:
Current level= 20 log (I /I) dB
10 0 i
Similarly, voltage level = 20 log V /V dB
0 i
Obviously, for power, we use a multiplying factor of 10 but for voltages and currents, we use
a multiplying factor of 20.644 Electrical Technology
17.6. Value of 1 dB
It can be proved that 1 dB represents the log of two powers, which have a ratio of 1.26.
P
1 dB = 10log 10 (P 2 /P 1 )or log 10 (P 2 /P 1 ) 0.1or 2 100.1 1.26
P
1
Hence, it means that + 1 dB represents an increase in power of 26%.
Example 17.1. The input and output voltages of a filter network are 16 mV and 8 mV
respectively. Calculate the decibel level of the output voltage.
Solution. Decibel level = 20log (V /V)dB = –20 log (V/V ) dB = –20log (16/8) = – 6 dB.
10 0 i 10 i 0 10
Whenever voltage ratio is less than 1, its log is negative which is often difficult to handle. In such
cases, it is best to invert the fraction and then make the result negative, as done above.
Example 17.2. The output power of a filter is 100 mW when the signal frequency is 5 kHz.
When the frequency is increased to 25 kHz, the output power falls to 50 mW. Calculate the dB
change in power.
Solution. The decibel change in power is
= 10 log (50/100) = – 10 log (100/50) = – 10 log 2 = – 10 × 0.3 = – 3 dB
10 10 10
Example 17.3. The output voltage of an amplifier is 10 V at 5 kHz and 7.07 V at 25 kHz.
What is the decibel change in the output voltage?
Solution. Decibel change = 20 log (V /V) = 20 log (7.07/10) = – 20 log (10/7.07)
10 0 i 10 10
= – 20 log (1.4/4)

= – 20 × 0.15 = – 3 dB
17.7. Low-Pass RC Filter
A simple low-pass RC filter is shown in Fig. 17.2 (a). As stated earlier, it permits signals of
low frequencies upto f to pass through while attenuating frequencies above f . The range of
c c
frequencies upto f is called the passband of the filter. Fig. 17.2 (b) shows the frequency response
c
curve of such a filter. It shows how the signal output voltage V varies with the signal frequency.
0
As seen at f , output signal voltage is reduced to 70.7% of the input voltage. The output is said to
c
be – 3 dB at f. Signal outputs beyond f roll-off or attenuate at a fixed rate of – 6 dB/octave or
c c
– 20 dB/decade. As seen from the frequency-phase response curve of Fig. 17.2 (c), the phase angle
between V and V is 45° at cutoff frequency f .
0 i c

c 0 i 0
V (b) R = X and V = V in magnitude. (c) The impedance phase angle θ = – 45°. The same is
i c R C
the angle between V and V.
0 i
As seen, the output voltage is taken across the capacitor. Resistance R offers fixed opposition
to frequencies but the reactance offered by capacitor C decreases with increase in frequency.
Hence, low-frequency signal develops over C whereas high-frequency signals are grounded. Signal
frequencies above f develop negligible voltage across C. Since R and C are in series, we can find
c
the low-frequency output voltage V developed across C by using the voltage-divider rule.

17.8. Other Types of Low-Pass Filters
There are many other types of low-pass filters in which instead of pure resistance, series
chokes are commonly used alongwith capacitors.
(i) Inverted–L Type. It is shown in Fig. 17.3 (a). Here, inductive reactance of the choke
blocks higher frequencies and C shorts them to ground. Hence, only low frequencies below f (for
c
which X is very low) are passed without significant attenuation.
(ii) T-Type. It is shown in Fig. 17.3 (b). In this case, a second choke is connected on the
output side which improves the filtering action.
(iii) πππππ-Type. It is shown in Fig. 17.3 (c). The additional capacitor further improves the
filtering action by grounding higher frequencies.
Fig. 17.3
It would be seen from the above figures that choke is always connected in series between the
input and the output and capacitors are grounded in parallel. The output voltage is taken across the
capacitor.
Example 17.4. A simple low-pass RC filter having a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz is connected
to a constant ac source of 10 V with variable frequency. Calculate the following :
(a) value of C if R=10kΩ (b) output voltage and its decibel level when
(i) f = f (ii) f =2f and (iii) f =10f .

17.9. Low-Pass RL Filter
It is shown in Fig. 17.4 (a).
Here, coil offers high reactance to
high frequencies and low
reactance to low frequencies.
Hence, low frequencies upto f
c
can pass through the coil without
much opposition. The output
voltage is developed across R.
Fig 17.4 (b) shows the frequency-
output response curve of the
filter. As seen at f , V = 0.707 V

and its attenuation level is –3 dB
with respect to V i.e. the voltage

However, it may be noted that being an RL circuit, the impedance phase angle is +45° (and
not –45° as in low-pass RC filter). Again at f , R = X .

17.10. High-Pass RC Filter
It is shown in Fig. 17.5 (a). Lower frequencies experience considerable reactance by the
capacitor and are not easily passed. Higher frequencies encounter little reactance and are easily
passed. The high frequencies passing through the filter develop output voltage V across R. As
0
seen from the frequency response of Fig. 13.5 (b), all frequencies above f are passed whereas
c
those below it are attenuated. As before, f corresponds to –3 dB output voltage or half-power
c
point. At f, R = X and the phase angle between V and V is +45° as shown in Fig. 17.5 (c). It may
c c 0 i
be noted that high-pass RC filter can be obtained merely by interchanging the positions of R and
C in the low-pass RC filter of Fig. 17.5 (a).

the voltage-divider rule, is

A very common application of the series
capacitor high-pass filter is a coupling
capacitor between two audio amplifier stages.
It is used for passing the amplified audio-
signal from one stage to the next and
simultaneously block the constant d.c. voltage.
Other high-pass RC filter circuits exist
besides the one shown in Fig. 17.5 (a). These
are shown in Fig 17.6. High-pass filter648 Electrical Technology
Fig. 17.6
(i) Inverted-L Type. It is so called because the capacitor and inductor from an upside down
L. It is shown in Fig. 17.6 (a). At lower frequencies, X is large but X is small. Hence, most of
C L
the input voltage drops across X and very little across X . However, when the frequency is
C L
increased, X becomes less but X is increased thereby causing the output voltage to increase.
C L
Consequently, high frequencies are passed while lower frequencies are attenuated.
(ii) T-Type. It uses two capacitors and a choke as shown in Fig. 17.6 (b). The additional
capacitor improves the filtering action.
(iii) π-Type. It uses two inductors which shunt out the lower frequencies as shown in Fig.
17.6 (c).
It would be seen that in all high-pass filter circuits, capacitors are in series between the input
and output and the coils are grounded. In fact, capacitors can be viewed as shorts to high
frequencies but as open to low frequencies. Opposite is the case with chokes.
17.11. High-Pass RL Filter
It is shown in Fig. 17.7 and can be obtained by
‘swapping’ position of R and L in the low-pass RL
circuit of Fig. 17.4 (a). Its response curves are the
same as for high-pass RC circuit and are shown in
Fig. 17.5 (b) and (c).
As usual, its output voltage equals the voltage
which drops across X . It is given by

17.12. R-C bandpass Filter
It is a filter that allows a certain band of frequencies to pass through and attenuates all other
frequencies below and above the passband. This passband is known as the bandwidth of the filter.
As seen, it is obtained by cascading a high-pass RC filter to a low-pass RC filter. It is shown in Fig.
17.8 alongwith its response curve. The passband of this filter is given by the band of frequencies
lying between f and f . Their values are given by

It is a series combination of low-pass and high-pass RC filters as shown in Fig. 17.9 (a). In
fact, it can be obtained by reversing the cascaded sequence of the RC bandpass filter. As stated
earlier, this filter attenuates a single band of frequencies and allows those on either side to pass
through. The stopband is represented by the group of frequencies that lie between f and f where

Moreover, unlike RL filters, RC filters can be produced
for filtering out unwanted channels, in CATV

17.14. The – 3 dB Frequencies
The output of an a.c. filter is said to be down 3 dB or –3 dB at the cutoff frequencies.
Actually at this frequency, the output voltage of the circuit is 70.7% of the maximum input voltage
as shown in Fig. 17.10 (a) for low-pass filter and in Fig. 17.10 (b) and (c) for high-pass and
bandpass filters respectively. Here, maximum voltage is taken as the 0 dB reference.

17.15. Roll-off of the Response Curve
Gradual decreasing of the output of an a.c. filter is called roll-off. The dotted curve in Fig.
17.11 (a) shows an actual response curve of a low-pass RC filter. The maximum output is defined
to be zero dB as a reference. In other words, 0 dB corresponds to the condition when V = v
0 i
because 20 log V /V = 20 log 1 = dB. As seen, the output drops from 0 dB to – 3 dB at the cutoff
10 0 i
frequency and then continues to decrease at a fixed rate. This pattern of decrease is known as the
roll-off of the frequency response. The solid straight line in Fig. 17.11 (a) represents an ideal
output response that is considered to be ‘flat’ and which cuts the frequency axis at f .
c
The roll-off for a basic IRC or IRL filter is 20 dB/decade or 6 dB/octave. Fig. 17.11 (b)
shows the frequency response plot on a semi-log-scale where each interval on the horizontal axis
represents a tenfold increase in frequency. This response curve is known as Bode plot. Fig.
17.11(c) shown the Bode plot for a high-pass RC filter on a semi-log graph. The approximate
actual response curve is shown by the dotted line. Here, the frequency is on the logarithmic scale
and the filter output in decibel is alongwith the linear vertical scale. The filter output is flat beyond
f. But as the frequency is reduced below f, the output drops at the rate of – 20 dB/decade.

17.16. Bandstop and Bandpass Resonant Filter Circuits
Frequency resonant circuits are used in electronic system to make either bandstop or
bandpass filters because of their characteristic Q-rise to either current or voltage at the resonant
frequency. Both series and parallel resonant circuits are used for the purpose. It has already been
discussed in Chap. No. 7 that
(i) a series resonant circuit offers minimum impedance to input signal and provides
maximum current. Minimum impedance equals R because X = X and maximum current I = V/R.
L C
(ii) a parallel circuit offers maximum impedance to the input signal and provides minimum
current. Maximum impedance offered is = L/CR and minimum current I = V/(L/CR).
17.17. Series-and Parallel-Resonant Bandstop Filters
The series resonant bandstop filter is shown in Fig. 17.12 (a) where the output is taken across
the series resonant circuit. Hence, at resonant frequency f , the output circuit ‘sees’ a very low
0
resistance R over which negligible output voltage V is developed. That is why there is a shape
0
resonant dip in the response curve of Fig. 17.12 (b). Such filters are commonly used to reject a
particular frequency such as 50-cycle hum produced by transformers or inductors or turn table
rumble in recording equipment.
For the series-resonant bandstop filter shown in Fig. 17.12 (a), the following relationships
hold good :

17.18. Parallel-Resonant Bandstop Filter
In this filter, the parallel-resonant circuit is in series with the output resistor R as shown in
Fig. 17.13. At resonance, the parallel circuit offers extremely high impedance to f (and nearby
0
frequencies) as compared to R. Hence the output voltage V at f developed across R is negligibly
0 0
small as compared to that developed across the parallel-resonant circuit. Following relationships

It should be noted that the same amplitude phase response curves apply both to the series
resonant and parallel-resonant bandstop filters. Since X predominates at lower frequencies,
C
phase angle θ is negative below f . above f , X predominates and the phase current leads. At

It can be obtained by transposing the circuit elements of a bandstop a parallel-resonant filter.
As shown in Fig. 17.15, the output is taken across the two-branch parallel-resonant circuit. Since
this circuit offers maximum impedance at resonance, this filter produces maximum output voltage

18.1. Circle Diagram of a Series Circuit
Circle diagrams are helpful in analysing the operating characteristics of circuits, which, under
some conditions, are used in representing transmission lines and a.c. machinery (like induction
motor etc.)
Consider a circuit having a constant reactance but variable resistance varying from zero to
infinity and supplied with a voltage of constant magnitude and frequency (Fig. 18.1).
Fig. 18.1 Fig. 18.2
If R = 0, then I = V/X or V/X and has maximum value . It will lag or lead the voltage by
L C
90° depending on whether the reactance is inductive or capacitive. In Fig. 18.2, angle θ represents
the phase angle. If R is now increased from its zero value, then I and θ will both decrease. In the
limiting case, when R = ∞, then I = 0 and θ = 0°. It is found that the locus of end point of current
vector OA or OB represents a semi-circuit with diameter equal to V/X as shown in Fig. 18.2. It can
be proved thus :
I = V/Z and sin θ = X/Z or Z = X/sin θ ∴ I = V sin θ/ X
For constant value of V and X, the above is the polar equation of a circle of diameter V/X.
This equation is plotted in Fig. 18.2. Here, OV is taken as reference vector. It is also seen that for
inductive circuit, the current semi-circle is on the right-hand side of reference vector OV so that
current vector OA lags by θ°. The current semi-circle for R-C circuit is drawn on the left hand side
of OV so that current vector OB lends OV by θ°. It is obvious that AM = I cos θ, hence AM
represents, on a suitable scale, the power consumed by the R-L circuit, Similarly, BN represents the
power consumed by the R-C circuit.
18.2. Rigorous Mathematical Treatment
We will again consider both R-L and R–C circuits. The voltage drops across R and X (or X )
L C
will be 90° out of phase with each other. Hence, for any given value of resistance, the vector
diagram for the two voltage drops (i.e. IR and IX) is a rightangled triangle having applied voltage
as the hypotenuse.
R.C. CircuitsCircle Diagrams 657
For a constant applied voltage and
reactance, the vector diagrams for different
values of R are represented by a series of right-
angled triangles having common hypotenuse as
shown in Fig. 18.3. The locus of the apex of the
right-angled voltage triangles is a semicircle
described on the hypotenuse. The voltage semi–
circle for R-L circuit (OAV) is on the right and
for R-C circuit (OBV) on the left of the reference
vector OV as shown in Fig. 18.3.
The foci of end points of current vectors are
also semi-circles as shown but their centres lie on
the opposite sides of and in an axis perpendicular
to the reference vector OV.

18.3. Constant Resistance But Variable Reactance
Fig. 18.4 shows two circuits having constant resistance but variable reactance X or X which
L C
vary from zero to infinity. When X = 0, current is maximum and equals V/R. For other values,
L
I =V/ R2+X2. Current becomes zero when X =∞. As seen from Fig. 18.5, the end point of
L L
the current vector describes a semi-circle with radius OC = V/2/R and centre lying in the reference
sector i.e. voltage vector OV. For R-C circuit, the semi-circle lies to the left of OV.

As before, power developed would be maximum when current vector makes an angle of 45°
with the voltage vector OV. In that case, current is I / 2 and P =VI /2.

18.4. Properties of Constant Reactance But Variable Resistance Circuit
From the circle diagram of Fig. 18.3, it is seen
that circuits having a constant reactance but variable
resistance or vice-versa have the following
properties :
(i) the current has limiting value
(ii) the power supplied to the circuit has a
limiting value also 36000 ohm 1% resistor
(iii) the power factor corresponding to maximum power supply is 0.707 (= cos 45°)
Obviously, the maximum current in the circuit is obtained when R = 0.
∴ I =V/X =V/ωL ... for R-L circuit
m L
=−V/X =−ωVC ... for R-C circuit
C
Now, power P taken by the circuit is VI cos θ and if
V is constant, then P∝I cosθ. Hence, the ordinates of
current semi-circles are proportional to I cos θ. The
maximum ordinate possible in the semi-circle represents
the maximum power taken by the circuit. The maximum
ordinate passes through the centre of semi-circle so that
current vector makes an angle of 45° with both the
diameter and the voltage vector OV. Obviously, power
factor corresponding to maximum power intake is cos 45°
= 0.707.

As said above, at maximum power, θ=45°, hence vector triangle for voltages is an isosceles
triangle which means that voltage drops across resistance and reactance are each equal to 0.707 of
supply voltage i.e. V/ 2. As current is the same, for maximum power, resistance equals reactance
i.e. R = X (or X ).
L C
Hence, the expression representing maximum power may be written as P = V2/2R.

18.5. Simple Transmission Line Circuit
In Fig. 18.7 (a) is shown a simple transmission circuit having negligible capacitance and
reactance. R and X represent respectively the resistance and reactance of the line and R represents
L L
load resistance.
If R and X are constant, then as R is varied, the current AM follows the equation I = (V/X)
L L
sin θ (Art. 18.1). The height AM in Fig. 18.7 (b) represents the power consumed by the circuit but,
in the present case, this power is consumed both in R and R . The power absorbed by each
L
resistance can be represented on the circle diagram.
In Fig. 18.7 (b), OB represents the line current when R = 0. The current OB =
L
V / (R2 X 2) and power factor is cos θ . The ordinate BN then represents on a different scale
L 1
the power dissipated in R only. OA represents current when R has some finite value i.e. OA =
L
V/ (R+R )2+X2. The ordinate AM represents total power dissipated, out of which ME is
L L
consumed in R and AE in R .
L
Fig. 18.7
In fact, if OA2 × R (= AE) is considered to be the output of the circuit (the power transmitted
L
by the line), then
AE

AM
With R and X constant, the maximum power that can be transmitted by such a circuit occurs
L
when the extremity of current vector OA coincides with the point of tangency to the circle of a
straight line drawn parallel to OB. Obviously, V times AE under these conditions represents the
maximum power and the power factor at that time is cos θ .

resistance of the coil and the value of the maximum power in the circuit and the maximum current.
Solution. Let the unknown resistance and reactance of the coil be R and X respectively

Example 18.8. A non-inductive resistance R, variable between 0 and 10 Ω., is connected in
series with a coil of resistance 3 Ω. and reactance 4 Ω. and the circuit supplied from a 240-V

(a) zero (b) 5 Ω. and (c) 10 Ω.. By means of the symbolic method, calculate the value of the
current when R = 5 Ω..
Solution. The locus of the current vector is a semi-circle whose centre is (0, V/2X) and whose
radius is obviously equal to V/2X. Now, V/2 X = 240/2 × 4 = 30 A.
Hence, the semi-circle is drawn as shown in Fig. 18.11 (b).
(a) Total resistance = 3 Ω. and X = 4 Ω. ∴ tan θ = 4/2 ∴ θ = 53°8′

Hence, current vector OA is drawn making an angle of 53º8′ with vector OV. Vector OA
measures 49 A.

Note. There is difference in the magnitudes of the currents and the angles as found by the two
different methods. It is so because one has been found exactly by mathematical calculations,
whereas the other has been measured from the graph.

The minimum power factor which corresponds to maximum phase difference between O′B
and O′V occurs when O′B is tangential to the semi-circle. In that case, O′B is perpendicular to
BC. It means that O′BC is a right-angled triangle.
Now, sin φ=BC/O′C=1/(1+1)=0.5;φ=30°
∴ Minimum p.f. = cos 30° = 0.866 (lag)
Current corresponding to minimum p.f. is O′B=O′C cos φ = 2 × 0.866 = 1.732 A.

19.1. Generation of Polyphase Voltage
The kind of alternating currents and voltages discussed in chapter 12 to 15 are known as
single-phase voltage and current, because they consist of a single alternating current and voltage
wave. A single-phase alternator was diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 11.1 (b) and it was shown
to have one armature winding only. But if the number of armature windings is increased, then it
becomes polyphase alternator and it produces as many independent voltage waves as the number
of windings or phases. These windings are displaced from one another by equal angles, the values
of these angles being determined by the number of phases or windings. In fact, the word ‘poly-
phase’ means poly (i.e. many or numerous) and phases (i.e. winding or circuit).
In a two-phase alternator, the armature windings are displaced 90 electrical degrees apart. A
3-phase alternator, as the name shows, has three independent armature windings which are 120
electrical degrees apart. Hence, the voltages induced in the three windings are 120° apart in time-
phase. With the exception of two-phase windings, it can be stated that, in general, the electrical
displacement between different phases is 360/n where n is the number of phases or windings.
Three-phase systems are the most common, although, for certain special jobs, greater number
of phases is also used. For example, almost all mercury-arc rectifiers for power purposes are either
six-phase or twelve-phase and most of the rotary converters in use are six-phase. All modern
generators are practically three-phase. For transmitting large amounts of power, three-phase is
invariably used. The reasons for the immense popularity of three-phase apparatus are that (i) it is
more efficient (ii) it uses less material for a given capacity and (iii) it costs less than single-phase
apparatus etc.
In Fig. 19.1 is shown a two-pole, stationary-armature, rotating-field type three-phase
alternator. It has three armature coils aa′,bb′ and cc′ displaced 120° apart from one another. With
the position and clockwise rotation of the poles as indicated in Fig. 19.1, it is found that the e.m.f.
induced in conductor ‘a’ for coil aa′ is maximum and its direction* is away from the reader. The
e.m.f. in conductor ‘b’ of coil bb′ would be maximum and away from the reader when the N-pole
has turned through 120° i.e. when N-S axis lies along bb′. It is clear that the induced e.m.f. in
conductor ‘b’ reaches its maximum value 120° later than the maximum value in conductor ‘a’. In
the like manner, the maximum e.m.f.
induced (in the direction away from
the reader) in conductor ‘c’ would
occur 120° later than that in ‘b’ or
240° later than that in ‘a’.
Thus the three coils have three
e.m.fs. induced in them which are
similar in all respects except that they
are 120° out of time phase with one
another as pictured in Fig. 19.3. Each
The rotary phase converter
voltage wave is assumed to be
sinusoidal and having maximum
value of E .
m
In practice, the space on the armature is completely covered and there are many slots per
phase per pole.
* The direction is found with the help of Fleming’s Right-hand rule. But while applying this rule, it
should be remembered that the relative motion of the conductor with respect to the field is
anticlockwise although the motion of the field with respect to the conductor is clockwise as shown.
Hence, thumb should point to the left.Polyphase Circuits 667
Fig. 19.2 illustrates the relative positions of the windings of a 3-phase, 4-pole alternator and
Fig. 19.4 shows the developed diagram of its armature windings. Assuming full-pitched winding
and the direction of rotation as shown, phase ‘a’ occupies the position under the centres of N and
S-poles. It starts at S and ends or finishes at F.
a a
Fig. 19.1 Fig. 19.2
The second phase ‘b’ start at S which is 120 electrical degrees apart from the start of phase
b
‘a’, progresses round the armature clockwise (as does ‘a’) and finishes at F. Similarly, phase ‘c’
b
starts at S, which is 120 electrical degrees away from S , progresses round the armature and
c b
finishes at F . As the three circuits are exactly similar but are 120 electrical degrees apart, the
c
e.m.f. waves generated in them (when the field rotates) are displaced from each other by 120°.
Assuming these waves to be sinusoidal and counting the time from the instant when the e.m.f. in
phase ‘a’ is zero, the instantaneous values of the three e.m.fs. will be given by curves of Fig. 193.
Their equations are :
e =E sinωt ... (i)
a m
e =E sin(ωt−120°) ... (ii)
b m
e =E sin(ωt−240°) ... (iii)
c m
As shown in Art. 11.23. alternating voltages may be represented by revolving vectors which
indicate their maximum values (or r.m.s. values if desired). The actual values of these voltages vary
from peak positive to zero and to peak negative values in one revolution of the vectors. In Fig. 19.5
are shown the three vectors representing the r.m.s. voltages of the three phases E , E and E (in
a b c
the present case E = E = E = E, say).
a b c
It can be shown that the sum of the three phase e.m.fs. is zero in the following three ways :
(i) The sum of the above three equations (i), (ii) and (iii) is zero as shown below :

(ii) The sum of ordinates of three e.m.f. curves of Fig. 19.3 is zero. For example, taking
ordinates AB and AC as positive and AD as negative, it can be shown by actual measurement that
AB + AC + (– AD) = 0
(iii) If we add the three vectors of Fig. 19.5 either vectorially or by calculation, the result is
zero.

Fig. 19.5 Fig. 19.6
19.2. Phase Sequence
By phase sequence is meant the order in which the three phases attain their peak or maximum
values. In the development of the three-phase e.m.fs. in Fig. 19.7, clockwise rotation of the field
system in Fig. 19.1 was assumed. This assumption made the e.m.fs. of phase ‘b’ lag behind that
Fig. 19.7
of ‘a’ by 120° and in a similar way, made that of ‘c’ lag behind that of ‘b’ by 120° (or that of ‘a’
by 240°). Hence, the order in which the e.m.fs. of phases a, b and c attain their maximum values
is a b c. It is called the phase order or phase sequence a→b→c as illustrated in Fig. 19.7 (a).
If, now, the rotation of the field structure of Fig. 19.1 is reversed i.e. made anticlockwise, then
the order in which the three phases would attain their corresponding maximum voltages would also
be reversed. The phase sequence would become a→b→c. This means that e.m.f. of phase ‘c’
would now lag behind that of phase ‘a’ by 120° instead of 240° as in the previous case as shown
in Fig. 19.7 (b). By repeating the letters, this phase sequence can be written as acbacba which is
the same thing as cba. Obviously, a three-phase system has only two possible sequences: abc and
cba (i.e. abc read in the reverse direction).670 Electrical Technology
19.3. Phase Sequence At Load
In general, the phase sequence of
the voltages applied to load is
determined by the order in which the 3-
phase lines are connected. The phase
sequence can be reversed by
interchanging any pair of lines. In the
case of an induction motor, reversal of
sequence results in the reversed
direction of motor rotation. In the case
of 3-phase unbalanced loads, the effect
of sequence reversal is, in general, to
cause a completely different set of
values of the currents. Hence, when
working on such systems, it is essential
that phase sequence be clearly specified
otherwise unnecessary confusion will
arise. Incidentally, reversing the phase
sequence of a 3-phase generator which
is to be paralleled with a similar
generator can cause extensive damage
to both the machines.
Fig. 19.8 illustrates the fact that by
interchanging any two of the three
Fig. 19.8
cables the phase sequence at the load can be
reversed though sequence of 3-phase supply
remains the same i.e. abc. It is customary to define
phase sequence at the load by reading repetitively
from top to bottom. For example, load phase
sequence in Fig. 19.8 (a) would be read as
abcabcabc– or simply abc. The changes are as
tabulated below :

Interchanged Sequence
a and b b a c b a c b a c – or c b a
b and c a c b a c b a c b – or c b a
c and a c b a c b a c b a – or c b a
19.4. Numbering of Phases
The three phases may be numbered 1, 2, 3 or a, b, c or as is customary, they may be given
three colours. The colours used commercially are red, yellow (or sometimes white) and blue. In
this case, the sequence is RYB.Polyphase Circuits 671
Obviously, in any three-phase system, there are two possible sequences in which the three coil
or phase voltages may pass through their maximum values i.e. red → yellow → blue (RYB) or red
→ blue → yellow (RBY). By convention, sequence RYB is taken as positive and RBY as negative.
19.5. Interconnection of Three Phases
If the three armature coils of the 3-phase alternator (Fig.
19.8) are not interconnected but are kept separate, as shown in
Fig. 19.9, then each phase or circuit would need two
conductors, the total number of conductors, in that case,
being six. It means that each transmission cable would contain
six conductors which will make the whole system complicated
and expensive.
Hence, the three
phases are
generally inter-
connected which
results in
substantialsaving
of copper. The
general methods Fig. 19.9
of interconnection are
(a) Star or Wye (Y) connection and
(b) Mesh or Delta (Δ ) connection.
3-phase alternator
19.6. Star or Wye (Y) Connection
In this method of interconnection, the similar* ends say, ‘star’ ends of three coils (it could
be ‘finishing’ ends also) are joined together at point N as shown in Fig. 19.10 (a).
The point N is known as star point or neutral point. The three conductors meeting at point
N are replaced by a single conductor known as neutral conductor as shown in Fig. 19.10 (b). Such
an interconnected system is known as four-wire, 3-phase system and is diagrammatically shown in
Fig. 19.10 (b). If this three-phase
voltage system is applied across a
balanced symmetrical load, the neutral
wire will be carrying three currents
which are exactly equal in magnitude
but are 120° out of phase with each
other. Hence, their vector sum is zero.
i.e. I + I + I = 0
R Y B
... vectorially
Fig. 19.10 The neutral wire, in that case,
may be omitted although its retention is useful for supplying lighting loads at low voltages (Ex.
19.22). The p.d. between any terminal (or line) and neutral (or star) point gives the phase or star
voltage. But the p.d. between any two lines gives the line-to-line voltage or simply line voltage.
19.7. Values of Phase Currents
When considering the distribution of current in a 3-phase system, it is extremely important to
bear in mind that :

at a particular instant. It should be clearly understood that at no instant will all the three currents
flow in the same direction either outwards or inwards. The three arrows indicate that first the
current flows outwards in phase R, then after a phase-time of 120°, it will flow outwards from
phase Y and after a further 120°, outwards from phase B.
(ii) the current flowing outwards in one or two conductors is always equal to that flowing
inwards in the remaining conductor or conductors. In other words, each conductor in turn,
provides a return path for the currents of the other conductors.
In Fig. 19.11 are shown the three phase currents, having the same peak value of 20 A but
displaced from each other by 120°. At instant ‘a’,
the currents in phases R and B are each + 10 A (i.e.
flowing outwards) whereas the current in phase Y is
– 20A (i.e. flowing inwards). In other words, at the
instant ‘a’, phase Y is acting as return path for the
currents in phases R and B. At instant b, I = +15 A
R
and I = +5 A but I = –20A which means that now
Y B
phase B is providing the return path.
At instant c, I = +15 A and I = +5A and
Y B
I = – 20A.
R
Hence, now phase R carries current inwards
whereas Y and B carry current outwards. Similarly at
point d, I = 0, I = 17.3 A and I = – 17.3 A. In Fig. 19.11
R B Y
other words, current is flowing outwards from phase
B and returning via phase Y.
In addition, it may be noted that although the distribution of currents between the three lines
is continuously changing, yet at any instant the algebraic sum of the instantaneous values of the
three currents is zero i.e. i + i + i = 0 – algebraically.

19.8. Voltages and Currents in Y-Connection
The voltage induced in each
winding is called the phase voltage
and current in each winding is likewise
known as phase current. However, the
voltage available between any pair of
terminals (or outers) is called line
voltage (V ) and the current flowing in
L
each line is called line current (I ).
L
As seen from Fig. 19.12 (a), in
this form of interconnection, there are
two phase windings between each pair
Fig. 19.12 of terminals but since their similar
ends have been joined together, they
are in opposition. Obviously, the instantaneous value of p.d. between any two terminals is the
arithmetic difference of the two phase e.m.fs. concerned. However, the r.m.s. value of this p.d. is
given by the vector difference of the two phase e.m.fs.
The vector diagram for phase voltages and currents in a star connection is shown in
Fig.19.12.Polyphase Circuits 673

Line voltage V between line 1 and line 2 is the vector difference of E and E .

(a) Line Voltages and Phase Voltages
The p.d. between line 1 and 2 is V = E – E ... vector difference.
RY R Y
Hence, V is found by compounding E and E reversed
RY R Y
and its value is given by the diagonal of the parallelogram of
Fig. 19.13. Obviously, the angle between E and E reversed is
R Y
60°. Hence if E = E = E = say, E – the phase e.m.f., then

Now V =V =Y = line voltage, say V . Hence, in

It will be noted from Fig. 19.13 that
1. Line voltages are 120° apart.
2. Line voltages are 30° ahead of their respective phase voltages.
3. The angle between the line currents and the corresponding line voltages is (30 + φ) with
current lagging.
(b) Line Currents and Phase Currents
It is seen from Fig. 19.12 (a) that each line is in series with its individual phase winding,
hence the line current in each line is the same as the current in the phase winding to which the line
is connected.
Current in line 1 = I ; Current in line 2 = I ; Current in line 3 = I
R Y B
Since I = I = I = say, I – the phase current
R Y B ph
∴ line current I = I

(c) Power
The total active or true power in the circuit is the sum of the three phase powers. Hence,
total active power = 3 × phase power or P = 3 × V I cos φ

Now V = V / 3 and I = I
ph L ph L
Hence, in terms of line values, the above expression becomes

* A balanced system is one in which (i) the voltages in all phases are equal in magnitude and offer in
phase from one another by equal angles, in this case, the angle = 360/3 = 120°, (ii) the currents in the
three phases are equal in magnitude and also differ in phase from one another by equal angles.
A 3-phase balanced load is that in which the loads connected across three phases are identical.674 Electrical Technology
It should be particularly noted that φ is the angle between phase voltage and phase current
and not between the line voltage and line current.

In this form, of interconnection the dissimilar ends of the three phase winding are joined
together i.e. the ‘starting’ end of one phase is joined to the ‘finishing’ end of the other phase and
so on as showing in Fig. 19.24 (a).
In other words, the three windings
are joined in series to form a closed
mesh as shown in Fig. 19.24 (b).
Three leads are taken out from
the three junctions as shown as
outward directions are taken as
positive.
It might look as if this sort

shortcircuiting the three windings. However, if the system is balanced then sum of the three
voltages round the closed mesh is zero, hence no current of fundamental frequency can flow
around the mesh when the terminals are open. It should be clearly understood that at any instant,
the e.m.f. in one phase is equal and opposite to the resultant of those in the other two phases.
This type of connection is also referred to as 3-phase, 3-wire system.
(i) Line Voltages and Phase Voltages
It is seen from Fig. 19.24 (b) that there is only one phase winding completely included
between any pair of terminals. Hence, in Δ-connection, the voltage between any pair of lines is
equal to the phase voltage of the phase winding connected between the two lines considered. Since
phase sequence is R Y B, the voltage having its positive direction from R to Y leads by 120° on that
having its positive direction from Y to B. Calling the voltage between lines 1 and 2 as V and that
RY
between lines 2 and 3 as V , we find that V lead V by 120°. Similarly, V leadsV by 120º

Current in line No. 2 is

When one of the resistors is disconnected

The circuit no longer remains a 3-phase circuit but consists of two 100 Ω resistors in series
across a 400-V supply. Current in lines A and C is = 400/200 = 2 A
Power absorbed in both = 400 × 2 = 800 W
Hence, by disconnecting one resistor, the power consumption is reduced by half.686 Electrical Technology
(ii) Delta Connection [Fig. 19.28 (b)]
In this case, currents in A and C remain as usual 120° out of phase with each other.
Current in each phase = 400/100 = 4 A
Power consumption in both = 2 × 42 × 100 = 3200 W
(or P = 2 × 4 × 400 = 3200 W)
In this case, when one resistor is disconnected, the power consumption is reduced by one-third.
Example 19.21. A 200-V, 3-φ voltage is applied to a balanced Δ-connected load consistingof
the groups of fifty 60-W, 200-V lamps. Calculate phase and line currents, phases voltages, power
consumption of all lamps and of a single lamp included in each phase for the following cases:
(a) under normal conditions of operation
(b) after blowout in line R′R (c) after blowout in phase YB
Neglect impedances of the line and internal resistances of the sources of e.m.f.
Solution. The load circuit is shown in Fig. 19.31 where each lamp group is represented by
two lamps only. It should be kept in mind that lamps remain at the line voltage of the supply
irrespective of whether the Δ-connected load is balanced or not.
(a) Normal operating conditions [Fig. 19.31 (a)]
Since supply voltage equals the rated voltage of the bulbs, the power consumption of the
lamps equals their rated wattage.
Power consumption/lamp = 60 W; Power consumption/phase = 50 × 60 = 3,000 W
Phase current = 3000/200 = 15 A ; Line current = 15× 3 = 26 A
(b) Line Blowout [Fig. 19.31 (b)]
When blowout occurs in line R, the lamp group of phase Y-B remains connected across line
voltage V YB =V y′B′ . However, the lamp groups of other two phases get connected in series across
the same voltage V . Assuming that lamp resistances remain constant, voltage drop across YR =
YB
V 200/2 = 100 V and that across RB = 100 V.

Hence, phase currents are as under :
I = 3000/200 = 15 A, I = I = 15/2 = 7.5 A

The line currents are :

RR YY BB YB YR
Power in phase YR = 100 × 7.5 = 750 W; Power/lamp = 750/50 = 15 W
Power in phase YB = 200 × 15 = 3000 W ; Power/lamp = 3000/50 = 60 W
Power in phase RB = 100 × 7.5 = 750 W ; Power/lamp = 750/50 = 15 W
Fig. 19.31Polyphase Circuits 687
(c) Phase Blowout [Fig. 19.31 (c)]
When fuse in phase Y-B blows out, the phase voltage becomes zero (though voltage across
the open remains 200 V). However, the voltage across the other two phases remains the same as
under normal operating conditions.
Hence, different phase currents are :
I 15A, I 15A, I 0

The line currents become
I 15 3 26A; I 15A, I 15A

Power in phase RY = 200 × 15 = 3000 W, Power/lamp = 3000/50 = 60 W
Power in phase RB = 200 × 15 = 3000 W, Power/lamp = 3000/50 = 60 W
Power in phase YB = 0; power/lamp = 0.

These currents are mutually displaced by 120°. The neutral current I is the vector sum* of
N
these three currents. I can be obtained by splitting up these three phase currents into their X-
N
components and Y-components and then by combining them together, in diagram 19.32 (b).
X-component = 46 cos 30° – 38.3 cos 30° = 6.64 A
Y-component = 57.5 – 46 sin 30° – 38.3 sin 30° = 15.3 A I 6.642 15.32 16.71A
N
The power absorbed = 230 (57.5 + 46 + 38.3) = 32.610 W
Example 19.24. A 3-phase, 4-wire system supplies power at 400 V and lighting at 230 V. If
the lamps in use require 70, 84 and 33 A in each of the three lines, what should be the current in
the neutral wire ? If a 3-phase motor is now started, taking 200 A from the line at a power factor
of 0.2, what would be the current in each line and the neutral current ? Find also the total power
supplied to the lamps and the motor. (Elect. Technology, Aligarh Univ.)
Solution. The lamp and motor connections are shown in Fig. 19.33.
Fig. 19.33
When motor is not started
The neutral current is the vector sum of lamp currents. Again, splitting up the currents into
their X- and Y-components, we get
X-component = 84 cos 30° – 33 cos 30° = 44.2 A
Y-component = 70 – 84 sin 30° – 33 sin 30° = 11.5 A
∴ I = 44.22+11.52 = 45.7 A
N
When motor is started
A 3-phase motor is a balanced load. Hence, when it is started, it will change the line currents
but being a balanced load, it contributes nothing to the neutral current. Hence, the neutral current
remains unchanged even after starting the motor.
Now, the motor takes 200 A from the lines. It means that each line will carry motor current
(which lags) as well as lamp current (which is in phase with the voltage). The current in each line
would be the vector of sum of these two currents.
Motor p.f. = 0.2 ; sin φ = 0.9799... from tables
Active component motor current = 200 × 0.2 = 40 A
* Some writers disagree with this statement on the ground that according to Kirchhoff’s Current Law, at
any junction, I + I + I + I = 0 ∴ I = – (I + I + I )
N R Y B N R Y B
Hence, according to them, numerical value of I is the same but its phase is changed by 180°.

19.11. Star and Delta connected Lighting Loads
In Fig. 19.34 (a) is shown a Y-connected lighting network in a three storey house. For such a
load, it is essential to have neutral wire in order to ensure uniform distribution of load among the
three phases despite random switching on and off or burning of lamps. It is seen from Fig. 1934(a),
Fig. 19.34
that network supplies two flats on each floor of the three storey residence and there is balanced
distribution of lamp load among the three phases. There are house fuses at the cable entry into the
building which protect the two mains against short-circuits in the main cable. At the flat entry, there
are apartment (or flat) fuses in the single-phase supply which protect the two mains and other flats in
the same building from short-circuits in a given building. There is no fuse (or switch) on the neutral
wire of the mains because blowing of such a fuse (or disconnection of such a switch) would mean a
break in the neutral wire. This would result in unequal voltages across different groups of lamps in
case they have different power ratings or number. Consequently, filaments in one group would burn
dim whereas in other groups they would burn too bright resulting in their early burn-out.
The house-lighting wire circuit for Δ-connected lamps is shown in Fig. 19.34 (b).
19.12. Power Factor Improvement
The heating and lighting loads supplied from 3-phase supply have power factors, ranging690 Electrical Technology
from 0.95 to unity. But motor loads have usually low lagging power factors, ranging from 0.5 to
0.9. Single-phase motors may have as low power factor as 0.4 and electric wedding units have even
lower power factors of 0.2 or 0.3.
kW kW
The power factor is given by cos or kVA
kVA cos
VI 1000 kVA
In the case of single-phase supply, kVA = or I = ∴ I ∝kVA
1000 V
3V I 1000 kVA
In the case of 3-phase supply kVA = L L or I = ∴ I ∝kVA
1000 L 3×V
L
In each case, the kVA is directly proportional to current. The chief disadvantage of a low p.f.
is that the current required for a given power, is very high. This fact leads to the following
undesirable results.
(i) Large kVA for given amount of power
All electric machinery, like alternators, transformers,
switchgears and cables are limited in their current-carrying capacity
by the permissible temperature rise, which is proportional to I2.
Hence, they may all be fully loaded with respect to their rated kVA,
without delivering their full power. Obviously, it is possible for an
existing plant of a given kVA rating to increase its earning capacity
(which is proportional to the power supplied in kW) if the overall
power factor is improved i.e. raised.
(ii) Poor voltage regulation
When a load, having allow lagging power factor, is switched Switchgear
on, there is a large voltage drop in the supply voltage because of the
increased voltage drop in the supply lines and transformers. This drop in voltage adversely affects
the starting torques of motors and necessitates expensive voltage stabilizing equipment for keeping
the consumer’s voltage fluctuations within the statutory limits. Moreover, due to this excessive
drop, heaters take longer time to provide the desired heat energy, fluorescent lights flicker and
incandescent lamps are not as bright as they should be. Hence, all supply undertakings try to
encourage consumers to have a high power factor.
Example 19.25. A 50-MVA, 11-kV, 3-φ alternator supplies full load at a lagging power factor
of 0.7. What would be the percentage increase in earning capacity if the power factor is increased
to 0.95 ?
Solution. The earning capacity is proportional to the power (in MW or kW) supplied by the
alternator.
MW supplied at 0.7 lagging = 50 × 0.7 = 35
MW supplied at 0.95 lagging = 50 × 0.95 = 47.5
increase in MW = 12.5
The increase in earning capacity is proportional to 12.5
∴ Percentage increase in earning capacity = (12.5/35) × 100 = 35.7
19.13. Power Correction Equipment
The following equipment is generally used for improving or correcting the power factor :
(i) Synchronous Motors (or capacitors)
These machines draw leading kVAR when they are over-excited and, especially, when theyPolyphase Circuits 691
are running idle. They are employed for correcting the power factor in bulk and have the special
advantage that the amount of correction can be varied by changing their excitation.
(ii) Static Capacitors
They are installed to improve the power factor of a group of a.c. motors and are practically
loss-free (i.e. they draw a current leading in phase by 90°). Since their capacitances are not
variable, they tend to over-compensate on light loads, unless arrangements for automatic switching
off the capacitor bank are made.
(iii) Phase Advancers
They are fitted with individual machines.
However, it may be noted that the economical degree of correction to be applied in each case,
depends upon the tariff arrangement between the consumers and the supply authorities.
Example 19.26. A 3-phase, 37.3 kW, 440-V, 50-Hz induction motor operates on full load
with an efficiency of 89% and at a power factor of 0.85 lagging. Calculate the total kVA rating of
capacitors required to raise the full-load power factor at 0.95 lagging. What will be the
capacitance per phase if the capacitors are (a) delta-connected and (b) star-connected ?
Solution. It is helpful to approach such problems from the ‘power triangle’ rather than from
vector diagram viewpoint.
Motor power input P = 37.3/0.89 = 41.191 kW
Power Factor 0.85 (lag)
cosφ =0.85:φ =cos −1 (0.85)=31.8º;tanφ =tan31.8º=0.62
1 1 1
Motor kVAR = P tan φ =41.91×0.62=25.98
1 1
Power Factor 0.95 (lag)
Motor power input P = 41.91 kW ... as before
It is the same as before because capacitors are loss-free i.e. they do not absorb any power.
cosφ =0.95 ∴φ =18.2º; tan18.2°=0.3288
2 2
Motor kVAR = P tan φ = 41.91 × 0.3288 = 13.79
2 2
The difference in the values of kVAR is due to the capacitors which supply leading kVAR to
partially neutralize the lagging kVAR of the motor.
Fig. 19.35
∴ leading kVAR supplied by capacitors is
= kVAR – kVAR = 25.98 – 13.79 = 12.19 ... CD in Fing. 19.35 (b)

Since capacitors are loss-free, their kVAR is the same as kVA
∴ kVA/capacitor = 12.19/3 = 4.063 ∴ VAR/capacitor = 4,063692 Electrical Technology

Example 19.27. If the motor of Example 19.24 is supplied through a cable of resistance
0.04Ω per core, calculate
(i) the percentage reduction in cable Cu loss and
(ii) the additional balanced lighting load which the cable can supply when the capacitors are

∴ Original Cu loss/conductor = 64.692 × 0.04 = 167.4 W
From Fig . 19.34, it is seen that the new kVA i.e.kVA when capacitors are connected is given

The total kVA which the cable can supply is 49.3 kVA. When
the capacitors are connected, the kVA supplied is 44.12 at a power
factor of 0.94 lagging. The lighting load will be assumed at unity
power factor. The kVA diagram is shown in Fig. 19.34. We will Fig. 19.36
tabulate the different loads as follows. Let the additional lighting
load be x kW.

From Fig. 19.36 it is seen that
AF = 41.91 + x and EF = 13.79 AE = resultant kVA = 49.3
Also AF2 + EF2 = AE2 or (41.91 + x)2 + 13.792 = 49.32 ∴ x = 5.42 kW
Example 19.28. Three impedance coils, each having a resistance of 20Ω and a reactance
of 15Ω, are connected in star to a 400-V, 3-φ, 50-Hz supply. Calculate (i) the line current
(ii) power supplied and (iii) the power factor.
If three capacitors, each of the same capacitance, are connected in delta to the same supply
so as to form parallel circuit with the above impedance coils, calculate the capacitance of each

When capacitors are connected
Power factor, cosφ = 0.95,φ = 18.2° ; tan 18.2° = 0.3288

Since capacitors themselves do not absorb any power, power remains the same i.e. 5,120 W
even whin capacitors are connected. The only thing that changes is the VAR.
Now VAR = P tanφ = 5120 × 0.3288 = 1684

19.14. Parallel Loads
A combination of balanced 3-phase loads connected in parallel may be solved by any one of
the following three methods :
1. All the given loads may be converted into equivalent Δ-loads and then combined together
according to the law governing parallel circuits.
2. All the given loads may be converted into equivalent Y-loads and treated as in (1) above.
3. The third method, which requires less work, is to work in terms of volt-amperes. The
special advantage of this approach is that voltameters can be added regardless of the kind of
connection involved. The real power of various loads can be added arithmetically and VARs may
be added algebraically so that total voltamperes are given by
VA= W2+VAR2 or S= P2+Q2
where P is the power in water and Q represents reactive voltamperes.
Example 19.29. For the power distribution system shown in Fig. 19.38, find
(a) total apparent power, power factor and magnitude of the total current I without the
T
capacitor in the system
(b) the capacitive kVARs that must be supplied by C to raise the power factor of the system
to unity ;
(c) the capacitance C necessary to achieve the power correction in part (b) above
(d) total apparent power and supply current I after the power factor correction.
T
Solution. (a) We will take the inductive i.e. lagging kVARs as negative and capacitive i.e.
leading kVARs as positive.
Total Q = – 16 + 6 – 12 = – 22 kVAR (lag); Total P = 30 + 4 + 36 = 70 kW
∴apparent power S= (−22)2+702 = 73.4 kVA; p.f. = cos φ = P/S = 70/73.4 = 0.95
S=VI or 73.4×103 =400×I ∴ I = 183.5 A
T T T
(b) Since total lagging kVARs are – 22, hence, for making the power factor unity, 22 leading
kVARs must be supplied by the capacitor to neutralize them. In that case, total Q = 0 and S = P
and p.f. is unity.
(c) If I is the current drawn by the capacitor, then 22 × 103 = 400 × I
C C
Now, I = V/X = VωC
C C
= 400×2π×50×C
∴20 103 400 (400 2 50 C);
∴ C = 483 μ F
(d) Since Q = 0,
hence, S= 102+702 = 70 kVA
Now, VI =70×103; Fig. 19.38
T
I =70×103/400 = 175 A.
T
It would be seen that after the power correction, lesser amount of current is required to
deliver the same amount of real power to the system.

[Nagpur University, November 1998]
Solution. (a) Three resistances are connected in star. Each resistance is of 100 ohms and
254 – V appears across it. Hence, a current of 2.54 A flows through the resistors and the concerned
power-factor is unity. Due to star-connection,

(b) Two Wattmeter Method
(i) This method gives true power in the 3-phase circuit without regard to balance or wave
form provided in the case of Y-connected load. The neutral of the load is isolated from
the neutral of the source of power. Or if there is a neutral connection, the neutral wire
should not carry any current. This is possible only if the load is perfectly balanced and
there are no harmonics present of triple frequency or any other multiples of that
frequency.Polyphase Circuits 701
(ii) This method can also be used for 3-phase, 4-wire system in which the neutral wire
carries the neutral current. In this method, the current coils of the wattmeters are
supplied from current transformers inserted in the principal line wires in order to get
the correct magnitude and phase differences of the currents in the current coils of the
wattmeter, because in the 3-phase, 4-wire system, the sum of the instantaneous currents
in the principal line wires is not necessarily equal to zero as in 3-phase 3-wire system.
(c) One Wattmeter Method
In this method, a single wattmeter is used to obtain the two readings which are obtained by
two wattmeters by the two-wattmeter method. This method can, however, be used only when the
load is balanced.
19.16. Three Wattmeter Method
A wattmeter consists of (i) a low resistance current coil which is inserted in series with the
line carrying the current and (ii) a high resistance pressure coil which is connected across the two
points whose potential difference is to be measured.
A wattmeter shows a reading which is proportional to the product of the current through its
current coil, the p.d. across its potential or pressure coil and cosine of the angle between this
voltage and current.
As shown in Fig. 19.46 in this method three wattmeters are inserted in each of the three
phases of the load whether Δ-connected or Y-connected. The current coil of each wattmeter carries
the current of one phase only and the pressure coil measures the phase-voltage of this phase.
Hence, each wattmeter measures the power in a single phase. The algebraic sum of the readings of
three wattmeters must give the total power in the load.
Fig. 19.46
The difficulty with this method is that under ordinary conditions it is not generally feasible
to break into the phases of a delta-connected load nor is it always possible, in the case of a
Y-connected load, to get at the neutral point which is required for connections as shown in Fig.
19.47 (b). However, it is not necessary to use three wattmeters to measure power, two wattmeters
can be used for the purpose as shown below.
19.17. Two Wattmeter Method-Balanced or Unbalanced Load
As shown in Fig. 19.41, the current coils of the two wattmeters are inserted in any two lines
and the potential coil of each joined to the third line. It can be proved that the sum of the
instantaneous powers indicated by W and W gives the instantaneous power absorbed by the three
1 2
loads L , L and L . A star-connected load is considered in the following discussion although it can
1 2 3
be equally applied to Δ-connected loads because a Δ-connected load can always be replaced by an
equivalent Y-connected load.
Now, before we consider the currents through and p.d. across each wattmeter, it may be
pointed out that it is important to take the direction of the voltage through the circuit the same
as that taken for the current when establishing the readings of the two wattmeters.702 Electrical Technology

∴ W +W =e (e −e )+i (e −e )=i e +i e −e (i +i )

Now, i +i +i = 0 ... Kirchhoff’s Current Law

∴ i +i =−i

where p is the power absorbed by load L , p that absorbed by L and p that absorbed by L
1 1 2 2 3 3
∴ W +W = total power absorbed
1 2
The proof is true whether the load is balanced or unbalanced. If the load is Y-connected, it
should have no neutral connection (i.e. 3 – φ, 3-wire connected) and if it has a neutral connection
(i.e. 3–φ, 4-wire connected) then it should be exactly balanced so that in each case there is no
neutral current i otherwise Kirchoff’s current law will give i +i +i +i = 0.
N N R y B
We have considered instantaneous readings, but in fact, the moving system of the wattmeter,
due to its inertia, cannot quickly follow the variations taking place in a cycle, hence it indicates the
average power.

19.18. Two Wattmeter Method–
Balanced Load
If the load is balanced, then power factor
of the load can also be found from the two
wattmeter readings. The Y-connected load in
Fig. 19.47 (b) will be assumed inductive. The
vector diagram for such a balanced Y-connected
load is shown in Fig. 19.48. We will now
consider the problem in terms of r.m.s. values
instead of instantaneous values. Fig. 19.48Polyphase Circuits 703
Let V , V and V be the r.m.s. values of the three phase voltages and I , I and I the r.m.s.

values of the currents. Since these voltages and currents are assumed sinusoidal, they can be
represented by vectors, the currents lagging behind their respective phase voltages by φ.
Current through wattmeter W [Fig. 19.47 (b)] is = I .

This V is foundby compounding V and V reversed as shown in Fig. 19.42. It is seen that

phase difference between V and I = (30° – φ).

∴ Reading of W = I V cos (30° – φ)

Similarly, as seen from Fig. 19.47 (b). Current through W = I

Y YB 2 Y YB
Since load is balanced, V = V = line voltage V ; I = I = line current, I
RB YB L Y R L
∴ W =V I cos(30°−Φ)andW =V I cos(30°+φ)

∴ W +W =V I cos(30°−φ)+V I (cos(30°+φ)

L L

L L L L
Hence, the sum of the two wattmeter readings gives the total power consumption in the
3-phase load.
It should be noted that phase sequence of RYBhas been assumed in the above discussion.
Reversal of phase sequence will interchange the readings of the two wattmeters.
19.19. Variations in Wattmeter Readings
It has been shown above that for a lagging power factor
W =V I cos(30°−ϕ)andW =V I cos(30°+φ)
1 L L 2 L L
From this it is clear that individual readings of the wattmeters not only depend on the load
but upon its power factor also. We will consider the following cases:
(a) When φ = 0 i.e. power factor is unity (i.e. resistive load) then,
W =W =V I cos30°
1 2 L L
Both wattmeters indicate equal and positive i.e. up-scale readings.
(b) When φ = 60° i.e. power factor = 0.5 (lagging)
Then W = V I cos (30° + 60°) = 0. Hence, the power is measured by W alone.
2 L L 1
(c) When 90° > φ > 60° i.e. 0.5 > p.f. > 0, then W is
1 φ 0° 60° 90°
still positive but reading of W is reversed because the phase
2 cosφ 1 0.5 0
angle between the current and voltage is more than 90°. For
getting the total power, the reading of W is to be subtracted W +ve +ve +ve

from that of W . +ve −ve

W 0
Under this condition, W will read ‘down scale’ i.e. 2 W =W W =W
2 1 2 1 2
backwards. Hence, to obtain a reading on W it is necessary
2704 Electrical Technology
to reverse either its pressure coil or current coil, usually the
All readings taken after reversal of pressure coil are to be taken as negative.
(d) When φ= 90° (i.e. pure inductive or capacitive load), then
W =V I cos(30°−90°)=V I sin30°;
1 L L L L
W =V I cos(30°+90°)=−V I sin30°
2 L L L L
As seen, the two readings are equal but of opposite sign.
∴ W +W =0
1 2
The above facts have been summarised in the above table for a lagging power factor.
19.20. Leading Power Factor*
In the above discussion, lagging angles are taken positive. Now, we will see how wattmeter
readings are changed if the power factor becomes leading. For φ = + 60° (lag), W is zero. But
2
for φ = – 60° (lead), W is zero. So we find that for angles of lead, the reading of the two
1
wattmeters are interchanged. Hence, for a leading power factor.
W =V I cos(30°+φ) and W =V I cos(30°−φ)

19.21. Power Factor–Balanced Load
In case the load is balanced (and currents and voltages are sinusoidal) and for a lagging
power factor:
W +W =V I cos(30°−φ)+V I cos(30°+φ)= 3V I cosφ ... (i)
1 2 L L L L L L
Similarly W −W =V I cos(30°−φ)−V I cos(30°+φ)

L L L L
3(W W ) **
1 2
Dividing (ii) by (i), we have tan ... (iii)
(W W )
1 2
Knowing tan φ and hence φ, the value of power factor cos φ can be found by consulting
the trigonometrical tables. It should, however, be kept in mind that if W reading has been taken
2
after reversing the pressure coil i.e. if W is negative, then the above relation becomes

Obviously, in this expression, only numerical values of W and W should be substituted. We

may express power factor in terms of the ratio of the two wattmeters as under:

If r is plotted against cos φ, then a curve called watt-ratio curve is obtained as shown in Fig.

19.22. Balanced Load – leading power factor
In this case, as seen from Fig. 19.50
W =V I cos(30+φ)
1 L L
and W =V I cos(30−φ)

∴ W +W = 3V I cosφ– as found above

Obviously, if φ > 60°, then phase angle between V and I becomes more than 90°. Hence,

W reads ‘down-scale’ i.e. it indicates negative reading. However, W gives positive reading even
1 2
in the extreme case when φ = 90°.
19.23. Reactive Voltamperes with Two Wattmeters
3(W −W )
We have seen that tanφ= 1 2
(W +W )
1 2
Since the tangent of the angle of lag between phase current and
phase voltage of a circuit is always equal to the ratio of the reactive
power to the active power (in watts), it is clear that 3(W – W ) Fig. 19.51
1 2
represents the reactive power (Fig. 19.51). Hence, for a balanced load, the reactive power is given
by 3 times the difference of the readings of the two wattmeters used to measure the power for a
3-phase circuit by the two wattmeter method. It may also be proved mathematically a follows:706 Electrical Technology
= 3(W −W )= 3[V I cos(30°−φ)−V I cos(30°−φ)]
1 2 L L L L
= 3V I (cos30°cosφ+sin30°sinφ−cos30°cosφ+sin30°sinφ)
L L
= 3V I sinφ
L L
19.24. Reactive Voltamperes with One Wattmeter
For this purpose, the wattmeter is connected as shown in Fig. 19.52 (a) and (b). The pressure
coil is connected across Y and B lines whereas the current coil is included in the R line. In Fig.
19.48 (a), the current coil is
connected between terminals A and
Bwhereas pressure coil is connected
between terminals C and D.
Obviously, current flowing through
the wattmeter is I and p.d. is V .
R YB
The angle between the two, as seen
from vector diagram of Fig. 19.48, is
(30 + 30 + 30 – φ) = (90 – φ)
Fig. 19.52
Hence, reading of the wattmeter is W =V I cos(90−φ)=V I sinφ
YB R YB R
For a balanced load, V equals the line voltage V and I equals the line current I , hence
YB L R L
W =V I sinφ
L L
We know that the total reactive voltamperes of the load are Q= 3V I sinφ.
L L
Hence, to obtain total VARs, the wattmeter reading must be multiplied by a factor of 3.
19.25. One Wattmeter Method
In this case, it is possible to apply two-wattmeter method by means of one wattmeter without
breaking the circuit. The current coil is connected in any one line and the pressure coil is
connected alternately between this and the other two lines
(Fig. 19.53). The two readings so obtained, for a balanced
load, correspond to those obtained by normal two wattmeter
method. It should be kept in mind that this method is not of
as much universal application as the two wattmeter method
because it is restricted to fairly balanced loads only.
However, it may be conveniently applied, for instance,
when it is desired to find the power input to a factory motor
in order to check the load upon the motor.
It may be pointed out here that the two wattmeters
Fig. 19.53
used in the two-wattmeter method (Art. 19.17) are usually
combined into a single instrument in the case of switchboard wattmeter which is then known as a
polyphase wattmeter. The combination is affected by arranging the two sets of coils in such a way
as to operate on a single moving system resulting in an indication of the total power on the scale.
19.26. Copper Required for Transmitting Power under Fixed Conditions
The comparison between 3-phase and single-phase systems will be done on the basis of a
fixed amount of power transmitted to a fixed distance with the same amount of loss and at the same
maximum voltage between conductors. In both cases, the weight of copper will be directlyPolyphase Circuits 707
proportional to the number of wires (since the distance is fixed) and inversely proportional to the
resistance of each wire. We will assume the same power factor and same voltage.

Hence, we find that for transmitting the same amount of power over a fixed distance with a
fixed line loss, we need only three-fourths of the amount of copper that would be required for a
single phase or to put it in another way, one-third more copper is required for a 1-phase system
than would be necessary for a three-phase system.
Example 19.38. Phase voltage and current of a star-connected inductive load is 150 V and
25 A. Power factor of load is 0.707 (lag). Assuming that the system is 3-wire and power is
measured using two wattmeters, find the readings of wattmeters.

Total power = 3V I cosφ= 3×150× 3×25×0.707 = 7954 W

∴ W +W = 7954 W ... (i)

cosφ=0.707;φ=cos −1(0.707)=45°;tan45°=1
Now, for a lagging power factor, tanφ= 3(W −W )/(W +W ) or 1 = 3(W −W )/7954
1 2 1 2 1 2
∴ (W −W ) = 4592 W ... (ii)

From (i) and (ii) above, we get, W = 6273 W; W = 1681 W.

Example 19.39. In a balanced 3-phase 400-V circuit, the line current is 115.5 A. When
power is measured by two wattmeter method, one meter reads 40 kW and the other zero. What is
the power factor of the load? If the power factor were unity and the line current the same, what
would be the reading of each wattmeter?
Solution. Since W = 0, the whole power is measured by W . As per Art. 19.18, in such a
2 1
situation, p.f. = 0.5. However, it can be calculated as under.
Since total power is 40 kW, ∴ 40,000 = 3 400 115.5 cos ; cos 0.5
If the power factor is unity with line currents remaining the same, we have

1 2
Also, (W +W )= 3×400×115.5×1 = 80000 W = 80 kW
1 2
As per Art. 19.19, at unity p.f., W = W . Hence, each wattmeter reads = 80/2 = 40 kW.

Solution. As given in Art. 19.21, when W reads negative, then we have

∴ W = 100 × 8.66 × cos 15° = 836.5 W

Similarly W =V I cosφ=100×8.66×cos75°= 224.1 W

Resistance of each delta branch = 20 cos 45° = 14.14 Ω
Total power consumed = 3 I2R = 3 × 52 × 14.14 = 1060.6 W
Hence, it proves that the sum of the two wattmeter readings gives the total power consumed.

From Eq. (ii) and (iii), we have W = 45 kW and W = – 5 kW

Since W comes out to be negative, second wattmeter reads ‘down scale’. Even otherwise it
2
is obvious that p.f. being less than 0.5, W must be negative (Art. 19.19)

Example 19.43. The power in a 3-phase circuit is measured by two wattmeters. If the total
power is 100 kW and power factor is 0.66 leading, what will be the reading of each wattmeter?
Give the connection diagram for the wattmeter circuit. For what p.f. will one of the wattmeter read
zero?
Solution. φ=cos −1(0.66)=48.7°;tanφ=1.1383
Since p.f. is leading,
3(W −W )
∴ tanφ=− 1 2 ∴ 1.1383 = 3(W W )/100

1 2
∴ W – W = – 65.7 and W + W = 100 ∴ W = 17.14 kW; W = 82.85 kW

Connection diagram is similar to that shown in Fig. 19.47 (b). One of the wattmeters will read
zero when p.f. = 0.5
Example 19.44. Two wattmeters are used for
measuring the power input and the power factor of an
over-excited synchronous motor. If the readings of the
meters are (– 2.0 kW) and (+ 7.0 kW) respectively,
calculate the input and power factor of the motor.
(Elect. Technology, Punjab Univ., June, 1991)

runs with a leading p.f., we should use the relationship
derived in Art. 19.22.

Example 19.46. The power input to a synchronous motor is measured by two wattmeters
both of which indicate 50 kW. If the power factor of the motor be changed to 0.866 leading,
determine the readings of the two wattmeters, the total input power remaining the same. Draw the
vector diagram for the second condition of the load. (Elect. Technology, Nagpur Univ. 1992)
Solution. In the first case both wattmeters read equal and positive. Hence motor must be
running at unity power (Art. 19.22).

Example 19.50. Three identical coils are connected in star to a 200-V, three-phase supply and
each takes 500 W. The power factor is 0.8 lagging. What will be the current and the total power if the
same coils are connected in delta to the same supply? If the power is measured by two wattmeters, what
will be their readings? Prove any formula used. (Elect. Engg. A.M. A. S.I. Dec. 1991)712 Electrical Technology

It should be noted that voltage across W is V and not V . Moreover,

W =V I cos(90°−φ)=400×30×sinφ=400×30×0.6 = 7.2 kW
2 YB R
Example 19.53. A 3-phase, 3-wire balanced load with a lagging power factor is supplied at
400 V (between lines). A I-phase wattmeter (scaled in kW) when connected with its current coil in
the R-line and voltage coil between R and Y lines gives a reading of 6 kW. When the same termi-
nals of the voltage coil are switched over to Y- and B-lines, the current-coil connections remaining
the same, the reading of the wattmeter remains unchanged. Calculate the line current and power
factor of the load. Phase sequence is R→Y →B. (Elect. Engg-1, Bombay Univ. 1985)
Solution. The current through the wattmeter is I and p.d. across its pressure coil is V . As
R RY
seen from the phasor diagram of Fig. 19.58, the angle between the two is (30°+φ).
∴ W =V I cos(30°+φ)=V I cos(30°+φ) ... (i)
1 RY R L L
In the second case, current is I but voltage is V . The angle between the two is (90° – φ)
R YB
∴ W =V I cos(90°−φ)=V I cos(90°−φ)
2 YB R L L
Since W =W we have
1 2
V I cos(30°+φ)=V I cos(90°−φ)
L L L L
∴ 30°+φ=90°−φ
or 2φ=60° ∴ φ=30°
∴ load power factor = cos 30° = 0.866 (lag)
Now W =W = 6 kW.

If we take the phase voltage as the reference voltage i.e. V =(1000/ 3)∠0°=578∠0°;

Example 19.59. A synchronous motor absorbing 50 kW is connected in parallel with a

factor of 0.9 lagging, find the kVAR supplied by the motor and its power factor.
(Elect. Machines, A.M.I.E. Sec B)
Solution. Load kVA = 200/0.8 = 250
Load kVAR = 250 × 0.6 = 150 (lag) [cos φ = 0.8 sin φ = 0.6]
Total combined load = 50 + 200 = 250 kW
kVA of combined load = 250/0.9 = 277.8
Combined kVAR = 277.8 × 0.4356 = 121 (inductive) (combined cos φ = 0.9, sin φ = 0.4356)
Hence, leading kVAR supplied by synch, motor = 150 – 121 = 29 (capacitive)
kVA of motor alone = (kW2+kVAR2) = 502+292 = 57.8

19.27. Double Subscript Notation
In symmetrically-arranged networks, it is comparatively easier and actually more advanta-
geous, to use single-subscript notation. But for unbalanced 3-phase circuits, it is essential to use
double subscript notation, in order to avoid unnecessary confusion which is likely to result in
serious errors.
Suppose, we are given two coils are whose induced e.m.fs. are 60° out of phase with eachother
[Fig. 19.65 (a)]. Next, suppose that it is required to connect these coils in additive series i.e. in such
Fig. 19.65
a way that their e.m.fs. add at an angle of 60°. From the information given, it is impossible to know
whether to connect terminal ‘a’ to terminal ‘c’ or to terminal ‘d’. But if additionally it were given that
e.m.f. from terminal ‘c’ to terminal ‘d’ is 60° out of phase with that from terminal ‘a’ to terminal ‘b’,
then the way to connect the coils is definitely fixed, as shown in Fig. 19.59 (b) and 19.60 (a). The
double-subscript notation is obviously very convenient in such cases. The order in which these sub-
scripts are written indicates the direction along which the voltage acts (or current flows). For example
the e.m.f. ‘a’ to ‘b’ [Fig. 19.59 (a)], may be written as E and that from ‘c’ to ‘d’ as E ..... The e.m.f.
ab cd
between ‘a’ and ‘d’ is E where E = E + E and is shown in Fig. 19.59 (b).
ad ad ab ad
Example 19.62. If in Fig. 19.60 (a), terminal ‘b’ is connected to ‘d’, find E if E = 100 V.
ac
Solution. Vector diagram is shown in Fig. 19.60 (b)
Obviously, E = E + E = E × (– E )
ac ab dc ab cd
Hence, E is reversed and added to E to get E as shown in Fig. 19.60 (b). The magnitude

of resultant vector is
E =2×100cos120°/2=100V; E = 100∠−60°

As shown in Fig. 19.67, vector E is reversed and then combined with E to get E .

Magnitude of E is given by 2 × 100 × cos 60° = 100 V but it leads E by 120°.

In Fig. 19.68 (b) is shown the vector diagram of the e.m.fs induced in the three phases 1, 2,
3 (or R, Y, B) of a 3-phase alternator [Fig.19.68 (a)]. According to double subscript notation, each
phase e.m.f. may be written as E , E and E , the order of the subscripts indicating the direction
01 02 03
in which the e.m.fs. act. It is seen that while passing from phase 1 to phase 2 through the external
circuit, we are in opposition to E .
02
E = E + E = (– E ) + E = E – E
12 20 01 02 01 01 02
Fig. 19.68 Fig. 19.69
It means that for obtaining E , E has to be reversed to obtain – E which is then combined
12 20 02
with E to get E (Fig. 19.69). Similarly,
01 12
E = E + E = (– E ) + E = E – E
23 30 02 03 02 02 03
E = E + E = (– E ) + E = E – E
31 10 03 01 03 03 01
By now it should be clear that double-subscript notation is based on lettering every junction
and terminal point of diagrams of connections and on the use of two subscripts with all vectors
representing voltage or current. The subscripts on the vector diagram, taken from the
diagram of connections, indicate that the positive direction of the current or voltage is from the
first subscript to the second. For example, ac-
cording to this notation I represents a current
ab
whose + ve direction is from a to b in the branch
ab of the circuit in the diagram of connections.
In the like manner, E represents the e.m.f.
ab
which produces this current. Further, I will rep-
ba
resent a current flowing from b to a, hence its
vector will be drawn equal to but in a direction
opposite to that of I i.e. I and I differ in
ab ab ba
phase by 180° although they do not differ in
magnitude. Fig. 19.69 (a)
In single subscript notation (i.e. the one in which single subscript is used) the + ve directionsare
fixed by putting arrows on the circuit diagrams as shown in Fig. 19.69 (a). According to this notation
E = – E + E = E – E ; E = – E + E = E – E and E = – E + E = E –E

Solution. It should be noted that V stands for the voltage of terminal a with respect to the

Alternative Method
This question may be easily solved
by Δ/Y conversion. The star equivalent of
the delta reactance is 100/3 Ω per phase.
As shown is Fig. 19.73, there are
now two parallel circuits across each
phase, one consisting of a resistance of
100 Ω and the other of a reactance of
100/3 Ω.

19.28. Unbalanced Loads
Any polyphase load in which the impedances in one or more phases differ from the imped-
ances of other phases is said to be an unbalanced load. We will now consider different methods to
handle unbalanced star-connected and delta-connected loads.
19.29. Unbalanced D-c onnected Load
Unlike unbalanced Y-connected load, the unbalanced Δ-connected load supplied from a bal-
anced 3-phase supply does not present any new problems because the voltage across each load
phase is fixed. It is independent of the nature of the load and is equal to line voltage. In fact, the
problem resolves itself into three independent single-phase circuits supplied with voltages which
are 120° apart in phase.
The different phase currents can be calculated in the usual manner and the three line currents
are obtained by taking the vector difference of phase currents in pairs.
If the load consists of three different pure resistances, then trigonometrical method can be
used with advantage, otherwise symbolic method may be used.
Example 19.66. A 3-phase, 3-wire, 240 volt, CBA system supplies a delta-connected load in
which Z = 25 ∠90º, Z = 15 ∠30°, Z = 20 ∠0º ohms. Find the line currents and total power.
AB BC CA
(Advanced Elect. Machines A.M.I.E. Sec. B, Summer 1991)
Solution. As explained in Art. 19.2, a 3-phase system
has only two possible sequences : ABC and CBA. In the ABC
sequence, the voltage of phase B lags behind voltage of phase
A by 120º and that of phase C lags behind phase A voltage by
240º. In the CBA phase which can be written as A → C → B,
voltage of C lags behind voltage A by 120º and that of B lags
behind voltage A by 240º. Hence, the phase voltage which can
be written as
E = E ∠ 0º ; E = E ∠ – 120º

under:

19.30. Four-wire Star-connected Unbalanced Load
It is the simplest case of an unbalanced load and may be treated as three separate single-
phase systems with a common return wire. It will be assumed that impedance of the line wires and
source phase windings is zero. Should such an assumption be unacceptable, these impedances can
be added to the load impedances. Under these conditions, source and load line terminals are at the
same potential.
Consider the following two cases:
(i) Neutral wire of zero impedance
Because of the presence of neutral wire (assumed to behaving zero impedance), the star
points of the generator and load are tied together and are at the same potential. Hence, the voltages
across the three load impedances are equalized and each is equal to the voltage of the correspond-
ing phase of the generator. In other words, due to the provision of the neutral, each phase voltage
is a forced voltage so that the three phase voltages are balanced when line voltages are balanced
even though phase impedances are unbalanced. However, it is worth noting that a break or open
(Z =∞) in the neutral wire of a 3-phase, 2-wire system with unbalanced load always causes
N
large (in most cases inadmissible) changes in currents and phase voltages. It is because of this
reason that no fuses and circuit breakers are ever used in the neutral wire of such a 3-phase system.
The solution for currents follows a pattern similar to that for the unbalanced delta.
Obviously, the vector sum of the currents in the three lines is not zero but is equal to neutral
current.Polyphase Circuits 729
(ii) Neutral wire with impedance Z
N
Such a case can be easily solved with the help of Node-pair Voltage method as detailed below.
Consider the general case of a Y- to -Y system with a neutral wire of impedance Z as shown in Fig.
n
19.79 (a). As before, the impedance of line wires and source phase windings would be assumed to be
zero so that the line and load terminals, R,Y, B and R′,Y′,B′ are the same respective potentials.
Fig. 19.79
According to Node-pair Voltage method, the above star-to-star system can be looked upon as
multi-mesh network with a single pair of nodes i.e. neutral points N and N'. The node potential i.e.
the potential difference between the supply and local neutrals is given by
E Y +E Y +E Y
V′ = R R Y Y B B
NN Y +Y +Y +Y
R Y B N
where Y ,Y and Y represent the load phase admittances. Obviously, the load neutral N' does
R Y B
not coincide with source neutral N. Hence, load phase voltages are no longer equal to one another
even when phase voltages are as seen from Fig. 19.79 (b).
The load phase voltage are given by
V′ = E −V′ V′ = E −V andV = E −V′
R R NN; Y Y NN B′ B NN
The phase currents are
I =V′Y , I′ =V′Y and I =V′Y
R R R Y Y Y B B B

Obviously, power would remain the same because magnitude of branch currents is unaltered.
From the above, we conclude that phase reversal in the case of a 4-wire unbalanced load supplied
from a balanced voltage system leads to the following changes:
(i) it changes the angles of phase currents but not their magnitudes.
(ii) however, power remains unchanged.
(iii) it changes the magnitude as well as angle of the neutral current I .

Example 19.71. A 3−φ, 4-wire, 380-V supply is connected to an unbalanced load having
phase impedances of: Z = (8 + j6) Ω, Z = (8 – j6) Ω and Z = 5Ω. Impedance of the neutral
R y B
wire is Z = (0.5 + j1)Ω.
N
Ignoring the impedances of line wires and internal impedances of the e.m.f. sources, find the
phase currents and voltages of the load.
Solution. This question will be solved by using Node-pair Voltage method discussed in Art.

19.31. Unbalanced Y-connected Load Without Neutral
When a star-connected load is unbalanced and it has no neutral wire. Then its star point is
isolated from the star-point of the generator. The potential of the load star-point is different from
that of the generator star-point. The potential of the former is subject to variations according to the
imbalance of the load and under certain conditions of loading, the potentials of the two star- point
may differ considerably. Such an isolated load star-point or neutral point is called ‘floating’ neutral
point because its potential is always changing and is not fixed.732 Electrical Technology
All Y-connected unbalanced loads supplied from polyphase systems have floating neutral
points without a neutral wire. Any unbalancing of the load causes variations not only of the poten-
tial of the star-point but also of the voltages across the different branches of the load. Hence, in
that case, phase voltage of the load is not 1/ 3 of the line voltage.
There are many methods to tackle such unbalanced Y-connected loads having isolated neu-
tral points.
1. By converting the Y-connected load to an equivalent unbalanced Δ-connected load by
using Y-Δ conversion theorem. The equivalent Δ-connection can be solved in Fig. 19.80. The
line currents so calculated are equal in magnitude and phase to those taken by the original unbal-
anced Y-connected load.
2. By applying Kirchhoff’s Laws.
3. By applying Millman’s Theorem.
4. By using Maxwell’s Mesh or Loop Current Method.
19.32. Millman’s Theorem
Fig. 19.83 shows a number of linear bilateral admittances, Y , Y , .... connected to a common

point or node Ο′. The voltages of the free ends of these admittances with respect to another
common point O are V , V ... V . Then, according to this theorem, the voltage of O′ with

19.34. Delta/Star and Star/Delta Conversions
Let us consider the unbalanced Δ-connected load of Fig. 19.85 (a) and Y-connected load of
Fig. 19.85 (b). If the two systems are to be equivalent, then the impedances between corresponding
pairs of terminals must be the same.
(i) Delta/Star Conversion
For Y-load, total impedance between terminals
1 and 2 is = Z + Z (it should be noted that double
1 2
subscript notation of Z and Z has been purposely
01 02
avoided).
Considering terminals 1 and 2 of Δ-load, we
find that there are two parallel paths having imped-
ances of Z and (Z + Z ). Hence, the equivalent
12 31 23
impedance between terminals 1 and 2 is given by

(iii) Star/Delta Conversion
The equations for this conversion can be obtained by rearranging equations (4), (5) and (6),
Rewriting these equations, we get

Z (Z + Z + Z ) = Z Z ... (8)

Dividing equation (7) by (9), we get 1 = 12 ∴ Z =Z 3

As in the previous case, it is to be noted that all impedances must be expressed in their
complex form.
Another point for noting is that the line currents of this equivalent delta are the currents in
the phases of the Y-connected load.

Each current is in phase with its own voltage because the load is purely resistive.
The line currents for the delta connection are obtained by compounding these phase currents
in pairs, either trigonometrically or by phasor algebra. Using phasor algebra and choosing V as

As a check, it may be verified that the difference of phase voltages taken in pairs should give
the three line voltages. Going through the circuit internally, we have

19.35. Unbalanced Star-connected Non-inductive Load
Such a case can be easily solved by direct geometrical method. If the supply system is sym-
metrical, the line voltage vectors can be drawn in the form of an equilateral triangle RYB (Fig.
19.94). As the load is an unbalanced one, its neutral point will not, obviously, coincide with the
centre of the gravity or centroid of the triangle. Let it lie at any other point like N. If point N
represents the potential of the neutral point if the unbalanced load, then vectors drawn from N to
points, R, Y and B represent the voltages across the
branches of the load. These voltages can be represented
in their rectangular co-ordinates with respect to the rect-
angular axis drawn through N. It is seen that taking co-
ordinates of N as (0, 0), the co-ordinates of point R are
[(V/2 – x), – y]
of point Y are [−(V/2+x),−y]
and of point B are [−x,( 3V/2−y)]

Example 19.78. The unbalanced circuit of Fig. 19.97 (a) is connected across a symmetrical
3-phase supply of 400-V. Calculate the currents and phase voltages. Phase sequence is RYB.
Solution. The line voltages are rep-
resented by the sides of an equilateral tri-
angle ABC in Fig. 19.97 (b). Since phase
impedances are unequal, phase voltages are
unequal and are represented by lengths, NA,
NB and NC where N is the neutral point
which is shifted from its usual position. CM
and ND are drawn perpendicular to hori-
zontal side AB. Let co-ordinates of point N
be (0, 0). Obviously, AM = BM = 200 V,
CM = 3 × 200 V, CM = 3 × 200 = 346
V. Let DM = x volts and ND = y volts.

Then, with reference to point N, the

∴ (32.76−0.26x−0.3y)+ j(11.68+0.3x−0.26y)=0
Obviously, the real component as well as the j-component must be zero.
∴ 32.76−0.26×−0.3y=0 and 11.68+0.3x−0.26y=0
Solving these equations for x and y, we have x = 31.9 V and y = 81.6 V

be no longer equal. The node pair voltage

19.36. Phase Sequence
Indicators
In unbalanced 3-wire star-con-
nected loads, phase voltages change con-
siderably if the phase sequence of the
supply is reversed. One or the other load
phase voltage becomes dangerously large
which may result in damage to the equip-
ment. Some phase voltage becomes too Fig. 19.102Polyphase Circuits 749
small which is equally deterimental to some types of electrical equipment. Since phase voltage
depends on phase sequence, this fact has been made the basis of several types of phase sequence
indicators.* A simple phase sequence indicator may be made by connecting two suitable incan-
descent lamps and a capacitor in a Y-connection as shown in Fig. 19.102. It will be found that for
phase sequence RYB, lamp L will glow because its phase voltage will be large whereas L will
1 2
not glow because of low voltage across it.
When, phase sequence is RBY, opposite conditions develop so that this time L glows but
2
not L .

Another method of determining the phase sequence is by means of a small 3-phase motor.
Once direction of rotation with a known sequence is found, the motor may be used thereafter for
determining an unknown sequence.

20.1. Fundamental Wave and Harmonics
Upto this stage, while dealing with alternating voltages and currents, it has been assumed that
they have sinusoidal waveform or shape. Such a waveform is an ideal one and much sought after
by the manufacturers and designers of alternators. But it is nearly impossible to realize such a
waveform in practice. All the alternating waveforms deviate, to a greater or lesser degree, from this
ideal sinusoidal shape. Such waveforms are referred to as non-sinusoidal or distorted or complex
waveforms.
Fig. 20.1 Fig. 20.2
Complex waveforms are produced due to the superposition of sinusoidal waves of different
frequencies. Such waves occur in speech, music, TV, rectifier outputs and many other applications
of electronics. On analysis, it is found that a complex wave essentially consists of
(a) a fundamental wave – it has the lowest frequency, say ‘f’
(b) a number of other sinusoidal waves whose frequencies are an integral multiple of the
fundamental or basic frequency like 2f, 3f and 4f etc.
The fundamental and its higher multiples form a harmonic series.
As shown in Fig. 20.1, fundamental wave itself is called the first harmonic. The second
harmonic has frequency twice that of the fundamental, the third harmonic has frequency thrice that
of the fundamental and so on.
Waves having frequencies of 2f, 4f and 6f etc. are called even harmonics and those having
frequencies of 3f, 5f and 7f etc. are called odd harmonics. Expressing the above is angular
frequencies, we may say that successive odd harmonics have frequencies of 3ω,5ω and 7ω etc.
and even harmonics have frequencies of 2ω, 4ω and 6ω etc.Harmonics 755
As mentioned earlier, harmonics are introduced in the output voltage of an alternator due to
many reason such as the irregularities of the flux distribution in it. Considerations of waveform and
form factor are very important in the
transmission of a. c. power but they
are of much greater importance in
radio work where the intelligibility
of a signal is critically dependent on
the faithful transmission of the
harmonic structure of sound waves.
In fact, it is only the rich harmonic
content of the consonants and lesser
at still plentiful harmonic content of
vowels which helps the ear to
distinguish a well regulated speech
from a more rhythmical succession
of musical sounds.
20.2. Different Complex Waveforms
Let us now find out graphically what
the resultant shape of a complex wave is
when we combine the fundamental with one
of its harmonics. Two cases would be
considered (i) when the fundamental and
harmonic are in phase with each other and
have equal or unequal amplitudes and
(ii)when there is some phase difference
between the two.
In Fig. 20.2 (a), the fundamental and
second harmonic, both having the same
amplitude, have been shown by the firm and
broken line respectively. The resultant
complex waveform is plotted out by
algebraically adding the individual ordinates
and is shown by thick line.
It may be noted that since the
maximum amplitude of the harmonic is
equal to the maximum amplitude of the
fundamental, the complex wave is said to
contain 100% of second harmonic.
Fig. 20.3 Fig. 20.4756 Electrical Technology
The complex wave of Fig. 20.2 (b) is made up of the fundamental and 4th harmonic, that of
Fig. 20.2 (c) consists of the fundamental and 3rd harmonic whereas that shown in Fig. 20.2 (d) is
made up of the fundamental and 5th harmonic. Obviously, in all there cases, there is no phase
difference between the fundamental and the harmonic.
Fig. 20.2 (a) and (c) have been reconstructed as Fig. 20.3 (a) and (b) respectively with the
only difference that in this case, the amplitude of harmonic is half that of the fundamental i.e. the
harmonic content is 50%.
The effect of phase difference between the fundamental and the harmonic on the shape of the
resultant complex wave has been illustrated in Fig. 20.4.
Fig. 20.4 (a) shows the fundamental and second harmonic with phase difference of π/2 and
Fig. 20.4 (b) shows the same with a phase difference of π. In Fig. 20.4 (c) and (d) are shown the
fundamental and third harmonic with a phase difference of π/2 and π respectively. In all these
figures, the amplitude of the harmonic has been taken equal to half that of the fundamental.
A careful examination of the above figures leads us to the following conclusions :
1. With odd harmonics, the positive and negative halves of the complex wave are symmetrical
whatever the phase difference between the fundamental and the harmonic. In other words, the first
and third quarters (i.e. ωt from 0 to π/2 and ωt from 3π/2) and the second and fourth
quarters (i.e. ωt from π/2 to π and ωt from 3π/2 to 2π) are respectively similar.
2. (i) When even harmonics are present and their phase difference with the fundamental is 0
or π, then the first and fourth quarters of the complex wave are of the same phase but inverted and
the same holds good for the second and third quarters.
(ii) When even harmonics are present and their phase difference with the fundamental is π/2
or 3π/2, then there is no symmetry as shown in Fig. 20 (a).
3. It may also be noted that the resultant displacement of the complex wave (whether
containing odd or even harmonics) is zero at ωt=0 only when the phase difference between the
fundamental and the harmonics is either 0 to π.
The above conclusions are of great help in analysing a complex waveform into its harmonic
constituents because a visual inspection of the complex wave enables us to rule out the presence
of certain harmonics. For example, if the positive and negative half-cycles of a complex wave are
symmetrical (i.e. the wave is symmetrical about ωt=0), then we need not look for even
harmonics. In some cases, we may be able to forecast the types of harmonics to be expected from
their mode of production. For example, in alternators which are symmetrically designed, we should
expect odd harmonics only.
20.3. General Equation of a Complex Wave
Consider a complex wave which is built up of the fundamental and a few harmonics, each of
which has its own peak value of phase angle. The fundamental may be represented by
e =E sin(ωt+Ψ )
1 1m 1
the second harmonic bye =E sin(2ωt+Ψ )
2 2m 2
the third harmonic by e =E sin (3ωt+Ψ ) and so on.
3 3m 3
The equation for the instantaneous value of the complex wave is given by
e = e + e + .... e = E sin (ωt+Ψ ) × E sin (2ωt+Ψ ) + .... + I sin (nωt+Ψ )
1 2 n 1m 1 2m 2 nm n
when E , E and E etc. denote the maximum values or the amplitudes of the fundamental,
1m 2m nm
second harmonic and nth harmonic etc. and Ψ, Ψ and Ψ represent the phase differences with
1 2 nHarmonics 757
respect to the complex wave* (i.e. angle between the zero value of complex wave and the
corresponding zero value of the harmonic).
The number of terms in the series depends on the shape of the complex wave. In relatively
simple waves, the number of terms in the series would be less, in others, more.
Similarly, the instantaneous value of the complex wave is given by
i=I sin(ωt+φ )+I sin(2ωt+φ )+.....+I sin(nωt+φ )
1m 1 2m 2 nm n
Obviously (Ψ −φ ) is the phase difference between the harmonic voltage and current for the
1 1
fundamental, (Ψ −φ ) for the second harmonic and (Ψ −Φ ) for the nth harmonic.

20.4. R.M.S. Value of a Complex Wave
Let the equation of the given complex current wave be
i I sin( t ) I sin(2 t ) ....I sin(n t )
1m 1 2m 2 nm n
Its r.m.s. value is given by I = average value of i2 over whole cycle
Now i2 =[I sin(ωt+φ )+I sin(2ωt+φ )+....I sin(nωt+φ )]2
1m 1 2m 1 nm n

+2I I sin(ωt+φ )sin(2ωt+φ )+2I I sin(ωt+Φ )sin(ωt+Φ )+....
1m 2m 1 2 1m 3m 1 2
The right-hand side of the above equation consists of two types of terms
(i) harmonic self-products, the general expression for which is I 2 sin2(pωt+φ ) for the
pm p
pth harmonic and
(ii) the products of different harmonics of the general form 2I I sin (pωt+φ ) sin
pm qm n
(qωt+φ )

The average value of i2 is the sum of the average values of these individual terms in the above
equation. Let us now find the average value of the general term I 2 sin2 (pωt+φ ) over a whole
pm p
cycle.

I = I / 2 – r.m.s. value of 2nd harmonic
2 2m
I = I / 2 – r.m.s. value of nth harmonic

Similarly, the r.m.s. value of a complex voltage wave is
E = 0.707 E 2+E 2+.....E 2 = E 2+E 2+...E 2
1m 2m nm 1 2 n
Hence, the rule is that the r.m.s. value of the complex current (or voltage) wave is given
by the square-root of the sum of the squares of the r.m.s. values of its individual components.
Note. If complex current wave contains a d.c. component of constant value I then its equation is

is thermoelectric ammeter, A a moving-coil ammeter and V an electrostatic voltmeter.
2
Solution. It may be noted that the
thermoelectric ammeter and the electrostatic
voltmeter record the r.m.s. values of the
current and voltage respectively. But the
moving coil ammeter records the average
values. Since the average values of the
sinusoidal waves are zero, hence the moving
coil ammeter reads the d.c. component of the
current only. The d.c. will pass only through
the inductive branch and not through the
capacitive branch.

20.6. Power Supplied by a Complex Wave
Let the complex voltage be represented by the equation
e=E sinωt+E sin2ωt+.....E sinnωt
1m 2m nm
be applied to a circuit. Let the equation of the resultant current wave be
i=I sin(ωt+φ )+I sin(2ωt+φ )+......I sin(nωt+φ )
1m 1 2m 2 nm n
The instantaneous value of the power in the circuit is p = ei watt
For obtaining the value of this product, we will have to multiply every term of the voltage
wave, in turn, by every term in the current wave. The average power supplied during a cycle would
be equal to the sum of the average values over one cycle of each individual product term. However,
as proved in Art. 20.4 earlier, the average value of all product terms involving harmonics of
different frequencies will be zero over one cycle, so that we need consider only the products of
current and voltage harmonics of the same frequency.
Let us consider a general term of this nature i.e. E sin nωt× I sin (nωt−φ ) and find

20.7. Harmonics in Single-phase A.C. Circuits
If an alternating voltage, containing various harmonics, is applied to a single-phase circuit
containing linear circuit elements, then the current so produced also contains harmonics. Each
harmonic voltage will produce its own current independent of others. By the principle of
superposition, the combined current can be found. We will now consider some of the well-known
elements like pure resistance, pure inductance and pure capacitance and then various combinations
of these. In each case, we will assume that the applied complex voltage is represented by
e=E sinωt+E sin2ωt+.....+E sinnωt
1m 2m nm
(a) Pure Resistance
Let the circuit have a resistance of R which is independent of frequency.
The instantaneous current i due to fundamental voltage is
1
E sinωt
i = 1m
1 R
E sin2ωt
Similarly, i = 2m for 2nd harmonic
2 R
E sinn t
and i nm ... for nth harmonic
n R
total current i=i +i +....+i
1 2 n
E sinωt E sin2ωt E sinnωt
= 1m + 2m +...+ nm
R R R
=I sinωt+I sin2ωt+.....+I sinnωt
1m 2m nm
It shows that
(i) the waveform of the resulting current is similar to that of the applied voltage i.e. the
two waves are identical.
(ii) the percentage of harmonic content in the current wave is the same as in the applied
voltage.
(b) Pure Inductance
Let the inductance of the circuit be L henry whose reactance varies directly as the frequency
of the applied voltage. Its reactance for the fundamental would be X = ωL; for the second
1
harmonic, X = 2ωL, for the third harmonic, X = 2ωL and for the nth harmonic X = nωL.
2 3 nHarmonics 763
However, for every harmonic term, the current will lag behind the voltage by 90°.
E
Current due to fundamental, i = 1m sin(ωt−π/2)
1 ωL
E
Current due to 2nd harmonic, i = 2m sin(2ωt−π/2)
2 2ωL
E
Current due to 3rd harmonic, i = 3m sin(3ωt−π/2)
3 3ωL

Current due to nth harmonic, i = nm sin(nωt−π/2)

∴ Total current i=i +i +.....i
1 2 n
E E E
1msin( t /2) 2m sin(2 t /2) .... nm sin(n t /2)
L 2 L n L
It can be seen from the above equation that
(i) the waveform of the current differs from that of the applied voltage.
(ii) for the nth harmonic, the percentage harmonic content in the current-wave is 1/n of the
corresponding harmonic content in the voltage wave. It means that in an inductive
circuit, the current waveform shows less distortion that the voltage waveform. In this
case, current more nearly approaches a sine wave than it does in a circuit containing
resistance.
(c) Pure Capacitance
In this case,
Capacitor
1 1
X 1 = ωC – for fundamental ; X 2 = 2ωC
– for 2nd harmonic
X 3 = 3ω 1 C – for 3rd harmonic ; X n = nω 1 C
– for nth harmonic
E
i = 1m sin(ωt+π/2)=ωCE sin(ωt+π/2)
1 1/ωC 1n
The amount of charge the device can
E store for a given voltage difference is
i = 2m sin(2ωt+π/2)=2ωCE sin(2ωt+π/2) called the capacitance
2 1/2ωC 2m
E
i = nm sin(nωt+π/2)= nωCE sin(nωt+π/2)
n 1/nωC nm
For every harmonic term, the current will lead the voltage by 90°.
Now i = i + i + ...... + i
1 2 n
=ωCE sin(ωt+π/2)+2ωCE sin(2ωt+π/2)+...+nωCE sin(nωt+π/2)
1m 2m nm
This equation shows that
(i) the current and voltage waveforms are dissimilar.
(ii) percentage harmonic content of the current is larger than that of the applied voltage
wave. For example, for nth harmonic, it would be n time larger.
(iii) as a result, the current wave is more distorted than the voltage wave.
(iv) effect of capacitor on distortion is just the reverse of that of inductance.764 Electrical Technology

harmonic content and 2% 7th harmonic content. Find the r.m.s. value of the fundamental and of
each harmonic. (Elect. Circuits, Gujarat Univ.)
Solution. Let V , V , V and V be the r.m.s. values of the fundamental and harmonic voltages.

20.8. Selective Resonance due to Harmonics
When a complex voltage is applied across a circuit containing both inductance and
capacitance, it may happen that the circuit resonates at one of the harmonic frequencies of the
applied voltage. This phenomenon is known as selective resonance.
If it is a series circuit, then large currents would be produced at resonance, even though the
applied voltage due to this harmonic may be small. Consequently, it would result in large harmonic
voltage appearing across both the capacitor and the inductance.768 Electrical Technology
If it is a parallel circuit, then at resonant frequency, the resultant current drawn from the
supply would be minimum.
It is because of the possibility of such selective resonance happening that every effort is made
to eliminate harmonics in supply voltage.
However, the phenomenon of selective resonance has been usefully employed in some wave
analyses for determining the harmonic content of alternating waveforms. For this purpose, a
variable inductance, a variable capacitor, a variable non-inductive resistor and a fixed non-
inductive resistance or shunt for an oscillograph are connected in series and connected to show the
wave-form of the voltage across the fixed non-inductive resistance. The values of inductance and
capacitance are adjusted successively to give resonance for the first, third, first and seventh
harmonics and a record of the waveform is obtained by the oscillograph. A quick inspection of the
shape of the waveform helps to detect the presence or absence of a particular harmonic.
Example 20.12. An e.m.f. e = 200 sin ωt + 40 sin 3 ωt + 10 sin 5 ωt is impressed on a
circuit comprising of a resistance of 10
Ω,
a variable inductor and a capacitance of 30 μF, all
connected in series. Find the value of the inductance which will give resonance with triple
frequency component of the pressure and estimate the effective p.f. of the circuit, ω=300 radian/

Generally, with the help of ammeter and voltmeter readings, the value of impedance,
inductance and capacitance of a circuit can be calculated. But while dealing with complex voltages,
the use of instrument readings does not, in general, give correct values of inductance and
capacitance except in the case of a circuit containing only pure resistance. It is so because, in the
case of resistance, the voltage and current waveforms are similar and hence the values of r.m.s.
volts and r.m.s amperes (as read by the voltmeter and ammeter respectively) would be the same
whether they ware sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal (i.e. complex).
(i) Effect on Inductances
Let L be the inductance of a circuit and E and I the r.m.s. values of the applied voltage and
current as read by the instruments connected in the circuit. For a complex voltage

For calculating the value of L from the above expression, it is necessary to known the
absolute value of the amplitudes of several harmonic voltages. But, in practices, it is more
convenient to deal with relative values than with absolute values. For this purpose, let us multiply
and divide the right-hand side of the above expression by E but write the E in the denominator in
its form 0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+.......)

If the effect of harmonics were to be neglected, then the value of the inductance would appear
to be E/ω I but the true or actual value is less than this. The apparent value has to be multiplied
by the quantity under the radical to get the true value of inductance when harmonics are present.
The quantity under the radical is called the correction factor i.e.
True inductance (L) = Apparent inductance (L′) × correction factor
(ii) Effect on Capacitance
Let the capacitance of the circuit be C farads and E and I the instrument readings for voltage
and current. Since the instruments read r.m.s. values, hence, as before,
E =0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+........)

∴ C=

Again, we will multiply and divide the right-hand side E but in this case, we will write E in
the numerator in its form [0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2+....)]
1m 3m 5m
∴ C 1 0.707 (E 2 E 2 E 2 ......)

Again, if the effects of harmonics were neglected, the value of capacitance would appear to
be I/ωE but its true value is less than this. For getting the true value, this apparent value will have
to be multiplied by the quantity under the radical (which, therefore, is referred to as correction
factor).*
∴ True capacitance (C) = Apparent capacitance (C′) × correction factor
Example 20.14. A current of 50-Hz containing first, third and fifth harmonics of maximum
values 100, 15 and 12 A respectively, is sent through an ammeter and an inductive coil of
negligibly small resistance. A voltmeter connected to the terminals shows 75 V. What would be the
current indicated by the ammeter and what is the exact value of the inductance of the coil in
henrys ?
* It may be noted that this correction factor is different from that in the case of pure inductance.Harmonics 771
Solution. The r.m.s. current is
I =0.707 I 2+I 2+I 2 =0.707 (1002+152+122) =72A

Hence, current indicated by the ammeter is 72 A
Now E =0.707 (E 2+E 2+E 2)

Also I = 1m;I = 3m ; I = 5m

∴ E =I ⋅ωL;E =I 3ωL;E =I ⋅5ωL

∴ E =0.707 (I ωL)2+(I 3ωL)2+(I 5ωL)2 =0.707ωL I 2+9I 2+25I 2

Example 20.15. The capacitance of a 20 μF capacitor is checked by direct connection to an
alternating voltage which is supposed to be sinusoidal, an electrostatic voltmeter and a
dynamometer ammeter being used for measurement. If the voltage actually follows the law,
e = 100 sin 250 t + 20 sin (500 – φ) + 10 sin (750 t – φ)
Calculate the value of capacitance as obtained from the direct ratio of the instrument readings.
Solution. True value, C = 20 μF
Apparent value C′= value read by the instruments
Now, C=C′ × correction factor.
Let us find the value of correction factor.
Here E = 100 ; E = 20 and E = 10

21.10. Harmonics in Different Three-phase Systems
In tree-phase systems, harmonics may be produced in the same way as in single-phase
systems.
Hence, for all calculation they are treated in the same manner i.e. each harmonic is treated
separately. Usually, even harmonics are absent in such systems. But care must be exercised when
dealing with odd, especially, third harmonics and all multiples of 3rd harmonic (also called the
triple-n harmonics).772 Electrical Technology
(a) Expressions for Phase E.M.Fs.
Let us consider a 3-phase alternator having identical phase windings (R, Y and B) in which
harmonics are produced. The three phase e.m.fs. would be represented in their proper phase
sequence by the equation.
e =E (ωt+Ψ )+E (3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ )+.....

e E sin t E sin 3 t E sin 5 t
B 1m 3 1 3m 3 3 5m 3 5
On simplification, these become
e =E sin(ωt+Ψ )+E (3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ )+..... – as before

From these expressions, it is clear that
(i) All third harmonics are equal in all phases of the circuit i.e. they are in time phase.
(ii) Fifth harmonics in the three phases have a negative phase sequence of R, B, Y because the fifth
harmonic of blue phase reaches its maximum value before that in the yellow phase.
(iii) All harmonics which are not multiples of three, have a phase displacement of 120º so that they can
be dealt with in the usual manner.
(iv) At any instant, all the e.m.fs. have the same direction which means that in the case of a Y-connected
system they are directed either away from or towards the neutral point and in the case of Δ-
connected system, they flow in the same direction.
Main points can be summarized as below :
(i) all triple-n harmonics i.e. 3rd, 9th, 15th etc. are in phase,
(ii) the 7th, 13th and 19th harmonics have positive phase rotation of R, Y, B.
(iii) the 5th, 11th and 17th harmonics have a negative phase sequence of R, B, Y.
(b) Line Voltage for a Star-connected System
In this system, the line voltages will be the difference between successive phase voltages and
hence will contain no third harmonic terms because they, being identical in each phase, will cancel
out. The fundamental will have a line voltage 3 times the phase voltage. Also, fifth harmonic has
line voltage 3 its phase voltage.
But it should be noted that in this case the r.m.s. value of the line voltage will be less than
3 times the r.m.s. value of the phase voltage due to the absence of third harmonic term from the
line voltage. It can be proved that for any line voltage.

where E , E etc. are r.m.s. values of the phase e.m.fs.
1 3
(c) Line Voltage for a Δ-connected System
If the winding of the alternator are delta-connected, then the resultant e.m.f. acting round the
closed mesh would be the sum of the phase e.m.fs. The sum of these e.m.fs. is zero for
fundamental, 5th, 7th, 11th etc. harmonics. Since the third harmonics are in phase, there will be a
resultant third harmonic e.m.f. of three times the phase value acting round the closed mesh. It will
produce a circulating current whose value will depend on the impedance of the windings at the
third harmonic frequency. It means that the third harmonic e.m.f. would be short-circuited by the
windings with the result that there will be no third harmonic voltage across the lines. The same is
applicable to all triple-n harmonic voltages. Obviously, the line voltage will be the phase voltage
but without the triple-n terms.
Example 20.16. A 3-φ generator has a generated e.m.f. of 230 V with 15 per cent third
harmonic and 10 per cent fifth harmonic content. Calculate
(i) the r.m.s. value of line voltage for Y-connection.
(ii) the r.m.s. value of line voltage for Δ-connection.
Solution. Let E , E , E be the r.m.s. values of the phase e.m.fs. Then
1 3 5
E = 0.15 E and E = 0.1 E
3 1 5 1
∴ 230= E 2+(0.15E )2+(0.1E )2
1 1 1
E = 226 V ∴ E = 0.15 × 226 = 34 V and E = 0.1 × 226=22.6 V
1 3 5
(i) r.m.s. value of the fundamental line voltage = 3×226=392V
r.m.s. value of third harmonic line voltage = 0
r.m.s. value of 5th harmonic line voltage 3×22.6= 39.2 V
∴ r.m.s. value of line voltage V = 3922+39.22 = 394 V
L
(ii) In Δ-connection, again the third harmonic would be absent from the line voltage
∴ r.m.s. value of line voltage V = 2262+22.62 =227.5 V
L
(d) Circulating Current in Δ-connected Alternator
Let the three symmetrical phase e.m.fs. of the alternator be represented by the equations,
e =E sin(ωt+Ψ )+E (3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ )+......
R 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5
e =E sin(ωt+Ψ −2π/3)+E sin(3ωt+Ψ )+E +sin(5ωt+Ψ −4π/3).....
Y 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5
e =E sin(ωt+Ψ −4π/3)+E sin(3ωt+Ψ )+E sin(5ωt+Ψ −2π/3)+....
B 1m 1 3m 3 5m 5
The resultant e.m.f. acting round the Δ-connected windings of the armature is the sum of
these e.m.fs. Hence it is given by e = e + e + e
R Y B
∴ e=3E sin(3ωt+φ )+3E sin(9ωt+Ψ )+3E sin(15ωt+Ψ )+......
3m 3 9m 9 15 15
If R and L represent respectively the resistance and inductance per phase of the armature
winding, then the circulating current due to the resultant e.m.f. is given by

(e) Three-phase four-wire System
In this case, there will be no third harmonic component in line voltage. For the 4-wire system,
each phase voltage (i.e. line to neutral) may contain a third harmonic component. If it is actually
present, then current will flow in the Y-connected load. In case load is balanced, the resulting third
harmonic line currents will all be in phase so that neutral wire will have to carry three times the
third harmonic line current. There will be no current in the neutral wire either at fundamental
frequency, or any harmonic frequency other than the triple-n frequency.
20.11. Harmonics in Single and 3-phase Transformers
The flux density in
transformer course is usually
maintained at a fairly high value in
order to keep the required volume
of iron to the minimum. However,
due to the non-linearity of
magnetisation curve, some third
harmonic distortion is always
produced. Also, there is usually a
small percentage of fifth
harmonic. The magnetisation
current drawn by the primary
contains mainly third harmonic
whose proportion depends on the
size of the primary applied
voltage. Hence, the flux is
sinusoidal.
In the case of three-phase
transformers, the production of 3-phase current transformer
harmonics will be affected by the
method of connection and the type of construction employed.
Δ
(a) Primary Windings -CONNECTED
Each primary phase can be considered as separately connected across the sinusoidal supply.
(i) The core flux will be sinusoidal which means that magnetizing current will contain 3rd
harmonic component in addition to relatively small amounts of other harmonics of higher order.
(ii) In each phase, these third harmonic currents will be in phase and so produce a circulating
current round the mesh with the result that there will be no third harmonic component in the line
current.
(b) Primary Winding Connected in 4-wire Star
Each phase of the primary can again be considered as separately connected across a
sinusoidal supply.Harmonics 775
(i) The flux in the transformer core would be sinusoidal and so would be the output voltage.
(ii) The magnetizing current will contain 3rd harmonic component. This component being in
phase in each winding will, therefore, return through the neutral wire.
(c) Primary Windings Connected 3-wire Star
Since there is no neutral wire, there will be no return path for the 3rd harmonic component
of the magnetizing current. Hence, there will exist a condition of forced magnetization so that core
flux must contain third harmonic component which is in phase in each limb of the transformer core.
Although there will be a magnetic path for these fluxes in the case of shell type
3-phase transformer, yet in the case of three-limb core type transformer, the third harmonic
component of the flux must return via the air. Because of the high reluctance magnetic path in such
transformers, the third harmonic flux is reduced to a very small value. However, if the secondary
of the transformer is delta-connected, then a third harmonic circulating current would be produced.
This current would be in accordance with Lenz’s law tend to oppose the very cause producing it
i.e. it would tend to minimize the third harmonic component of the flux.
Should the third and fifth secondary be Y-connected, then provision of an additional
Δ-connected winding, in which this current can flow, becomes necessary. This tertiary winding
additionally served the purpose of preserving magnetic equilibrium of the transformer in the case
of unbalanced loads. In this way, the output voltage from the secondary can be kept reasonably
sinusoidal.
Example 20.17. Determine whether the following two waves are of the same shape
e = 10 sin (ωt + 30º) – 50 sin (3ωt – 60º) + 25 sin (5ωt + 40º)
i = 1.0 sin (ωt – 60º) + 5 sin (3ωt – 150º) + 2.5 cos (5ωt – 140º)
(Principles of Elect. Engg-II Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. Two waves possess the same waveshape
(i) if they contain the same harmonics
(ii) if the ratio of the corresponding harmonics to their respective fundamentals is the same
(iii) if the harmonics are similarly spaced with respect to their fundamentals.
In other words,
(a) the ratio of the magnitudes of corresponding harmonics must be constant and
(b) with fundamentals in phase, the corresponding harmonics of the two waves must be in
phase.
The test is applied first by checking the ratio of the corresponding harmonics and then
coinciding the fundamentals by shifting one wave. If the phase angles of the corresponding
harmonics are the same, then the two waves have the same shape.
In the present case, condition (i) is fulfilled because the voltage and current waves contain the
same harmonics, i.e. third and fifth.
Secondly, the ratio of the magnitude of corresponding current and voltage harmonics is the
same i.e. 1/10.
Now, let the fundamental of the current wave be shifted ahead by 90º so that it is brought in
phase with the fundamental of the voltage wave. It may be noted that the third and fifth harmonics
of the current wave will be shifted by 3 × 90º = 270° and 5 × 90º = 450º respectively. Hence, the
current wave becomes
i′=1.0sin(ωt−60º+90º)+5sin(3ωt−150º+270º)+2.5cos(5ωt−140º+450º)
=1.0sin(ωt+30º)+5sin(3ωt+120º)+2.5cos(5ωt+310º)776 Electrical Technology
=1.0sin(ωt+30º)−5sin(3ωt−60º)+2.5sin(5ωt+40º)
It is seen that now the corresponding harmonics of the voltage and current waves are in phase.
Since all conditions are fulfilled, the two waves are of the same waveshape.

(cid:169) With the help of Fourier Theorem, it is
possible to determine the magnitude, order
and phase of the several hormonics
present in a complex periodic wave780 Electrical Technology
21.1. Harmonic Analysis
By harmonic analysis is meant the process of determining the magnitude, order and phase of
the several harmonics present in a complex periodic wave.
For carrying out this analysis, the following methods are available which are all based on
Fourier theorem:
(i) Analytical Method–the standard Fourier Analysis
(ii) Graphical Method– (a) by Superposition Method (Wedgemore’ Method) (b) Twenty four
Ordinate Method
(iii) Electronic Method–by using a special instrument called ‘harmonic analyser’
We will consider the first and third methods only.
21.2. Periodic Functions
A function f (t) is said to be periodic if f(t+T)= f(t) for all values of t where T is some
positive number. This T is the interval between two successive repetitions and is called the period
of f (t). A sine wave having a period of T =2π/ω is a common example of periodic function.
21.3. Trigonometric Fourier Series
Suppose that a given function f (t) satisfies the following conditions (known as Dirichlet
conditions):
1. f (t) is periodic having a period of T.
2. f (t) is single-valued everywhere.
3. In case it is discontinuous, f (t) has a finite number of discontinuities in any one period.
4. f (t) has a finite number of maxima and minima in any one period.
The function f(t) may represent either a voltage or current waveform. According to Fourier
theorem, this function f (t) may be represented in the trigonometric form by the infinite series.
f(t)=a +a cosω t+a cos2ω t+a cos3ω t+...+a cosnω t

It is seen from the above Fourier Series that the periodic function consists of sinusoidal
components of frequency 0, ω ,2ω ....nω . This representation of the function f(t) is in the
0 0 0
frequency domain. The first component a with zero frequency is called the dc component. The
0
sine and cosine terms represent the harmonics. The number n represents the order of the
harmonics.
When n = 1, the component (a cosω t+b sinω t) is called the first harmonic or the
1 0 1 0
fundamental component of the waveform.
When n = 2, the component (a cos2ω t+b sin2ω t) is called the second harmonic of the
2 0 2 0
waveform.
The nth harmonic of the waveform is represented by (a cosnω t+b sinnω t). It has a

frequency of nω i.e. n times the frequency of the fundamental component.

21.4. Alternate Forms of Trigonometric Fourier Series
Eq. (i) given above can be written as

n 0 n n 0 n
∴ a = A cosφ and b = A sinφ
n n n n n n
∴ A a 2 b 2 and tan 1b /a
n n n n n n
Similarly, let (a cosnω t+b sinnω t= A sin(nω t+Ψ ))
n 0 n 0 n 0 n

n 0 n n 0 n

∴ A = a 2+b 2 and ψ=tan −1a /b

21.7. Different Types of Functional Symmetries
A non-sinusoidal wave can have the following types of symmetry:
1. Even Symmetry
The function f (t) is said to possess even symmetry if f (t) = f (– t).
It means that as we travel equal amounts in time to the left and right of the origin (i.e. along
the + X-axis and –X-axis), we find the function to have the same value. For example in
Fig.21.2(a), points A and B are equidistant from point O. Here the two function values are equal
and positive. At points C and D, the two values of the function are again equal, though negative.
Such a function is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis. Examples of even function are: t2,
Fig. 21.2786 Electrical Technology
cos 3t, sin2 5t (2 + t2 + t4) and a constant A because the replacement of t by (– t) does not change
the value of any of these functions. For example, cosωt=cos(−ωt).
This type of symmetry can be easily recognised graphically because mirror symmetry exists
about the vertical or f (t) axis. The function shown in Fig. 21.2 has even symmetry because when
folded along vertical axis, the portions of the graph of the function for positive and negative time
fit exactly, one on top of the other.
The effect of the even symmetry on Fourier series is that the constant b = 0 i.e. the wave has
n
no sine terms. In general, b , b , b ... b = 0. The Fourier series of an even function contains only
1 2 3 n
a constant term and cosine terms i.e.
∑ ∞ ∑ ∞ 2πn
f(t)=a + a cosnω t=a + a cos t
0 n 0 0 n T
n=1 n=1
The value of a may be found by integrating over any half-period.
z n z
2 π 4 T/2
∴ a = f(θ)cosnθdθ= f(t)cosnωtdt
n π 0 T 0
2. Odd Symmetry
A function f (t) is said to possess odd symmetry if f(−t)=−f(t).
It means that as we travel an equal amount in time to the left or right from the origin, we find
the function to be the same except for a reversal in sign. For example, in Fig. 21.3 the two points
A and B are equidistant from point O. The two function values at A and B are equal in magnitude
but opposite in sign. In other words, if we replace t by (– t), we obtained the negative of the given
function. The X-axis divides an odd function into two halves with equal areas above and below the
X-axis. Hence, a = 0.
0
Examples of odd functions are: t, sin t, t cos 50 t(t+t3+t5)andt (1+t2)
A sine function is an odd function because sin (−ωt)=−sinωt .
Fig. 21.3
An odd function has symmetry about the origin rather than about the f(t) axis which was the
case for an even function. The effect of odd symmetry on a Fourier series is that it contains no
constant term or consine term. It means that a = 0 and a = 0 i.e. a , a , a ....a = 0. The Fourier
0 n 1 2 3 n
series expansion contains only sine terms.

∴ b = f(θ)sinnθdθ= f(t)sinnωtdt
n π 0 T 0
3. Half-wave Symmetry or Mirror-Symmetry or Rotational Symmetry
A function f (t) is said to possess half-wave symmetry if f(t)=−f(t±T/2)or−f(t)= f(t±T/2).
It means that the function remains the same if it is shifted to the left or right by half a period
and then flipped over (i.e. multiplied by – 1) in respect to the t-axis or horizontal axis. It is called
mirror symmetry because the negative portion of the wave is the mirror image of the positive
portion of the wave displaced horizontally a distance T/2.
In other words, a waveform possesses half symmetry only when we invert its negative half-
cycle and get an exact duplicate of its positive half-cycle. For example, in Fig. 21.4 (a) if we invert
the negative half-cycle, we get the dashed ABC half-cycle which is exact duplicate of the positive
half-cycle. Same is the case with the waveforms of Fig. 21.4 (b) and Fig. 21.4 (c). In case
Fig. 21.4
of doubt, it is helpful to shift the inverted half-cycle by a half-period to the left and see if it super-
imposes the positive half-cycle. If it does so, there exists half-wave symmetry otherwise not. It is
seen that the waveform of Fig. 21.4 (d) does not possess half-wave symmetry. It is so because
when its negative half-cycle is inverted and shifted by half a period to the left it does not
superimpose the positive half-cycle.
It may be noted that half-wave symmetry may be present in a waveform which also shows
either odd symmetry or even symmetry:
For example, the square waveform shown in Fig. 21.4 (a) possesses even symmetry whereas
the triangular waveform of Fig. 24.4 (b) has odd symmetry. All cosine and sine waves possess half-
wave symmetry because

It is worth noting that the Fourier series of any function which possesses half-wave symmetry
has zero average value and contains only odd harmonics and is given by788 Electrical Technology

4. Quarter-wave Symmetry
An odd or even function with rotational symmetry is said to possess quarter-wave symmetry.
Fig. 21.5 (a) possesses half-wave symmetry as well as odd symmetry. The wave shown in Fig.
21.5 (b) has both half-wave symmetry and even symmetry.
The mathematical test for quarter-wave symmetry is as under:
Odd quarter-wave f(t)=−f(t+T/2)andf(−t)=−f(t)
Even quarter-wave f(t)=−f(t+T/2)andf(t)= f(−t)
Fig. 21.5
Since each quarter cycle is the same in a way having quarter-wave symmetry, it is sufficient
to integrate over one quarter period i.e. from 0 to T/4 and then multiply the result by 4.
(i) If f(t) or f(θ) is odd and has quarter-wave symmetry, then a is 0 and a is 0. Hence, the
0 n
Fourier series will contain only odd sine terms.
∴ f(t)=∑ ∞ b sin 2πnt or f(θ)=∑ ∞ b sinnθ, whereb = 1∫2π f(θ)sinnθdθ

21.8. Line or Frequency Spectrum
A plot which shows the amplitude of each frequency component in a complex waveform is
called the line spectrum or frequency spectrum (Fig. 21.6). The amplitude of each frequency
component is indicated by the length of
the vertical line located at the
corresponding frequency. Since the
spectrum represents frequencies of the
harmonics as discrete lines of appropriate
height, it is also called a discrete
spectrum. The lines decrease rapidly for
waves having convergent series. Waves
with discontinuities such as the sawtooth
and square waves have spectra whose
amplitudes decrease slowly because their
series have strong high harmonics. On
the other hand, the line spectra of
waveforms without discontinuities and
with a smooth appearance have lines Fig. 21.6
which decrease in height very rapidly.
The harmonic content and the line spectrum of a wave represent the basic nature of that wave
and never change irrespective of the method of analysis. Shifting the zero axis changes the
symmetry of a given wave and gives its trigonometric series a completely different appearance but
the same harmonics always appear in the series and their amplitude remains constant.
Fig. 21.7
Fig. 21.7 shows a smooth wave alongwith its line spectrum. Since there are only sine terms

21.9. Procedure for Finding the Fourier Series of a Given Function
It is advisable to follow the following steps:
1. Step No. 1
If the function is defined by a set of equations, sketch it approximately and examine for
symmetry.
2. Step No. 2
Whatever be the period of the given function, take it as 2π (Ex. 20.6) and find the Fourier
series in the form
f(θ)=a +a cosθ+a cos2θ+...+a cosnθ+b sinθ+b sin2θ+...+b sinnθ
0 1 2 n 1 2 n
3. Step No. 3
The value of the constant a can be found in most cases by inspection. Otherwise it can be
0
found as under:
z z
1 2π 1 π
a = f(θ)dθ= f(θ)dθ
0 2π 0 2π −π
4. Step No. 4
If there is no symmetry, then a is found as above whereas the other two fourier constants can
0
be found by the relation.
z z
1 2π 1 π
a = f(θ)cosnθdθ= f(θ)cosnθdθ
n π 0 π −π
z z

b = f(θ)sinnθdθ= f(θ)sinnθdθ
n 0 π −π
5. Step No. 5
If the function has even symmetry i.e. f(θ)= f(−θ), then b = 0 so that the Fourier series
n
will have no sine terms. The series would be given by
z z

∑ 1 2π 2 π
f(θ)=a + a cosnθdθwherea = f(θ)cosnθ= f(θ)cosnθdθ
0 n n π π
0 0
n=1
6. Step No. 6
If the given function has odd symmetry i.e. f(−θ)=−f(θ) then a = 0 and a = 0. Hence,
0 n
there would be no cosine terms in the Fourier series which accordingly would be given by
∞ z z
f(θ)= ∑ b n sinω 0 t; where b n = π 1 2π f(θ)sinnθdθ= π 2 π f(θ)sinnθdθ
n=1 0 0
7. Step No. 7
If the function possesses half-wave symmetry i.e. f(θ)=−f(θ±π) or f(t)=−f(t±T/2),
then a is 0 and the Fourier series contains only odd harmonics. The Fourier series is given by
0

8. Step No. 8
If the function has even quarter-wave symmetry then a = 0 and b = 0. It means the Fourier

series will contain no sine terms but only odd cosine terms. It would be given by

21.10. Wave Analyzer
A wave analyzer is an instrument designed to measure the individual amplitude of eachharmonic
Fig. 21.8
component in a complex waveform. It is the simplest form of analysis in the frequency domain and
can be performed with a set of tuned filters and a voltmeter. That is why such analyzers are also
called frequency-selective voltmeters. Since
such analyzers sample the frequency spectrum
successively, i.e. one after the other, they are
called non-real-time analyzers.
The block diagram of a simple wave
analyzer is shown in Fig. 21.8. It consists of a
tunable fundamental frequency selector that
detects the fundamental frequency f which is
1
the lowest frequency contained in the input
waveform.
Once tuned to this fundamental frequency,
a selective harmonic filter enables switching to
multiples of f . After amplification, the output
1
is fed to an a.c. voltmeter, a recorder and a Wave analyzer
frequency counter. The voltmeter reads the
r.m.s amplitude of the harmonic wave, the recorder traces its waveform and the frequency counter
gives its frequency. The line spectrum of the harmonic component can be plotted from the above
data.
For higher frequencies (MHz) heterodyne wave analyzers are generally used. Here, the input
complex wave signal is heterodyned to a higher intermediate frequency (IF) by an internal local
oscillator. The output of the IF amplifier is rectified and is applied to a dc voltmeter called
heterodyned tuned voltmeter.794 Electrical Technology
The block diagram of a wave analyzer using the heterodyning principle is shown in Fig. 21.9.
Fig. 21.9
The signal from the internal, variable-frequency oscillator heterodynes with the input signal
in a mixer to produce output signal having frequencies equal to the sum and difference of the
oscillator frequency f and the input frequency f . Generally, the bandpass filter is tuned to the ’sum
0 1
frequency’ which is allowed to pass through. The signal coming out of the filter is amplified,
rectified and then applied to a dc voltmeter having a decibel-calibrated scale. In this way, the peak
amplitudes of the fundamental component and other harmonic components can be calculated.
21.11. Spectrum Analyzer
It is a real-time instrument i.e. it simultaneously displays on a CRT, the harmonic peak
Fig. 21.10
values versus frequency of all wave
components in the frequency range of the
analyzer. The block diagram of such an
analyzer is shown in Fig. 21.10.
As seen, the spectrum analyzer uses a
CRT in combination with a narrow-band
superheterodyne receiver. The receiver is
tuned by varying the frequency of the
voltage-tuned variable-frequency oscillator
which also controls the sawtooth generator
that sweeps the horizontal time base of the
Spectrum analyzer
CRT deflection plates. As the oscillator isFourier Series 795
swept through its frequency band by the sawtooth generator, the resultant signal mixes and beats
with the input signal to produce an intermediate frequency (IF) signal in the mixer. The mixer
output occurs only when there is a corresponding harmonic component in the input signal which
matches with the sawtooth generator signal. The signals from the IF amplifier are detected and
further amplified before applying them to the vertical deflection plates of the CRT. The resultant
output displayed on the CRT represents the line spectrum of the input complex or nonsinusoidal
waveform.
21.12. Fourier Analyzer
A Fourier analyzer uses digital signal processing technique and provides information
regarding the contents of a complex wave which goes beyond the capabilities of a spectrum
analyzer. These analyzers are based on the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform using an
algorithm called the fast Fourier transformer. This algorithm calculates the amplitude and phase of
each harmonic component from a set of time domain samples of the input complex wave signal.
Fig. 21.11
A basic block diagram of a Fourier analyzer is
shown in Fig. 21.11. The complex wave signal
applied to the instrument is first filtered to remove
out-of-band frequency components. Next, the signal
is applied to an analog/digital (A/D) convertor
which samples and digitizes it at regular time
intervals until a full set of samples (called a time
record) has been collected. The microprocessor then
performs a series of computations on the time data
to obtain the frequency-domain results i.e.
amplitude versus frequency relationships. These
results which are stored in memory can be
displayed on a CRT or recorded permanently with a
recorder or plotter.
Fourier Analyzer
Since Fourier analyzers are digital
instruments, they can be easily interfaced with a computer or other digital systems. Moreover, as
compared to spectrum analyzers, they provide a higher degree of accuracy, stability and repeatability.
21.13. Harmonic Synthesis
It is the process of building up the shape of a complex waveform by adding the instantaneous
values of the fundamental and harmonics. It is a graphical procedure based on the knowledge of the
different components of a complex waveform.796 Electrical Technology
Example 21.1. A complex voltage waveform contains a fundamental voltage of r.m.s. value
220 V and frequency 50 Hz alongwith a 20% third harmonic which has a phase angle lagging by
3π/4 radian at t = 0. Find an expression representing the instantaneous complex voltage v.
Using harmonic synthesis, also sketch the complex waveform over one cycle of the fundamental.
Solution. The maximum value of the fundamental voltage is = 200× 2 = 310 V. Its angular
velocity is ω =2π×50 = 100π rad/s. Hence, the fundamental voltage is represented by 310 sin
100πt.
The amplitude of the third harmonic = 20% of 310 = 62V. Its frequency is 3 × 50 = 150 Hz.
Hence, its angular frequency is = 2π×150=300π rad/s. Accordingly, the third harmonic voltage
can be represented by the equation 62 sin (300πt−3π/4). The equation of the complex voltage
is given by υ = 310 sin 100πt+62sin(300πt−3π/4).
Fig 21.12
In Fig. 21.12 are shown one cycle of the fundamental and three cycles of the third harmonic
component initially lagging by 3π/4 radian or 135°. By adding ordinates at different intervals,
the complex voltage waveform is built up as shown.
Incidentally, it would be seen that if the negative half-cycle is reversed, it is identical to the
positive half-cycle. This is a feature of waveforms possessing half-wave symmetry which contains
the fundamental and odd harmonics.
Example 21.2. For the nonsinusoidal wave shown in Fig. 21.13, determine (a) Fourier
coefficients a , a and b and (b) frequency of the fourth harmonic if the wave has a period of 0.02

Solution. The function f(θ) has a constant value from
θ = 0 to θ = 4π/3 radian and 0 value from θ=4π/3
radian to θ=2π radian.

Example 21.3. Find the Fourier series of the “half sinusoidal” voltage waveform which
represents the output of a half-wave rectifier. Sketch its line spectrum.
Solution. As seen from Fig. 21.14 (a), T = 0.2 second, f = 1/T = 1/0.2 = 5 Hz and
0
ω = 2 f = 10π rad/s. Moreover, the function has even symmetry. Hence, the Fourier series

will contain no sine terms because b = 0.

The limits of integration would not be taken from t = 0 to t = 0.2 second, but from t = – 0.5
to t = 0.15 second in order to get fewer equations and hence fewer integrals. The function can be
written as

= – f (t). Hence, its Fourier series will contain only sine terms i.e. a = 0. The function also

series will have only odd harmonics. In the present case, there would be only odd sine terms. Since
the waveform possesses quarter-wave symmetry, it is necessary to integrate over only one quarter

22.1. Introduction
It is quite an easy job to calculate the steady current, which flows in a circuit, when it is
connected to a d.c. generator or a battery. Similarly, the alternating current which flows in a circuit
when connected to an alternator can also be calculated by the various method discussed in
Chapters 13 and 14. These currents are known as steady currents because in such cases, it is
assumed that (i) the circuit components are constant and (ii) the circuit has been connected to the
generator long enough for any disturbance produced on initial switching, to resolve itself.
In general, transients disturbances are produced whenever
(a) an apparatus or circuit is suddenly connected to or disconnected from the supply,
(b) a circuit is shorted and
(c) there is a sudden change in the applied voltage from one finite value to another.
We will now discuss the transients produced whenever different circuits are suddenly
switched on or off from the supply voltage. In each case, we will assume that the resultant current
consists of two parts (i) a final steady-stage or normal current and (ii) a transient current
superimposed on the steady-stage current.
It is essential to remember that the transient currents are not driven by any part of the applied
voltage but are entirely associated with the changes in the stored energy in inductors and capacitors.
Since there is no stored energy in resistors, there are no transients in pure resistive circuits.
22.2. Types of Transients
There are single-energy transients and double-energy transients. Single-energy transients are
those in which only one form of energy, either electromagnetic or electrostatic is involved as in
R-L and R-C circuits.
However, double-energy transients are those in which both electromagnetic or electrostatic is
involved as in R-L-C circuits Transient disturbances may be further classified as follows :
(a) Initiation Transients : These are produced when a circuit, which is originally
dead, is energised.
(b) Subsidence Transients : These are produced when an energised circuit is rapidly
de-energised and reaches an eventual steady-stage of zero
current or voltage, as in the case of short-circuiting an R-L
or R-C circuit suddenly.
(c) Transition Transients : These are due to sudden but energetic changes from one
steady state to another.
(d) Complex Transients : These are produced in a circuit which is simultaneously
subjected to two transients due to two independent
disturbances or when the disturbing force producing the
transients is itself variable.
(e) Relaxation Transients : In these transients, the transition occurs cyclically towards
states, which when reached, become unstable themselves.
A distinction may also be made between free and forced transients which are produced due
to the applied voltage being itself transient.
22.3. Important Differential Equations
Some of the important differential equations, used in the treatment of single and double
energy transients, are given below. We will consider both first-order and second-order differential
equations.Transients 817

22.4. Transients in R-L Circuits (D.C.)
If i, I and i be the resultant current, steady-state current and transient current respectively in

R–L circuit of Fig. 22.1 (a), then by superimposition, the equation for the resultant current, for the
duration of initiation transient, is

∴ i =I e −t/λ ... (v)

where λ=L/R is called the time-constant of the circuit. Its reciprocal R/L is called the damping
coefficient of the circuit. The current decreases exponentially as shown in Fig. 22.1 (b). From
Eq. (i) and (v), we have
i=I +I e −t/λ ... (vi)
s 0
If the time is reckoned when the voltage V is applied, so that when t = 0, i = 0, then from
equation (vi), we get
0=I +i e −0=I +I ∴ I =−I =− V
s 0 s 0 0 s R
In that case, Eq. (vi) becomes
i= V − V e −t/λ ... (vii)

Curves for I and i have been plotted in Fig. 22.1 (b). The curve for resultant current has been

t R
Theoretically, the transient current i takes infinite
t
time to die off but, in practice, it disappears in a very short
time.
The values of resultant, steady-state and transient
voltages across the resistor can be found by multiplying
Eq. (vii) by R and are shown in Fig. 22.2. The e.m.f. of
self-induction–Ldi/dt is only transient in nature and equals
t
i R as seen from Eq. (ii) above.
Fig. 22.2 t
22.5. Short Circuit Current
After some time, the transient
current would disappear and the only
current flowing in the circuit would be
the steady-state current I = V/R. Let
s
the R-L circuit be closed upon itself
i.e. be short-circuited by shifting the
switch [Fig. 22.1 (a)] to position 2.
Since the voltage V has been excluded
from the circuit, the trapped current I
s
will immediately cease to be a steady-
state current, but on the other hand,
will become the initial value I of a
0
new subsidence transient current i.

If time is measured at the instant of short-circuit, so that when t = 0, the current is I = V/R, then

This equation has been plotted in Fig. 22.3. The only
voltage acting in the circuit is that due to self-induction i.e.

22.6. Time Constant
The time constant of a circuit is defined as the time it
would take for the transient current to decrease to zero, if the Fig. 22.3
decrease were linear instead of being exponential.
In other words, it is the time during which the transient current would have decreased to zero,
had it maintained its initial rate of decrease.
The initial rate of decrease can be found by differentiating Eq. (vi) and putting t = 0

The time-period would be equal to the sub-tangent OT drawn to the exponential curve of

If we put t =λ in Eq. (v), then i = I e–1 = I /e = I /2.718 = 0.37 I

Hence, time period of a circuit is the time during which the transient current decreases to 0.37
of its initial value.
Example 22.1. A coil having a resistance of 30 ω and an inductance of 0.09 H is connected
across a battery of 20 V. Plot the current and its two components. Assume that t = 0 when the
circuit is completed. (Electromechanic Allahabad Univ. 1992)

Solution. The two components of the circuit current are (i) steady current I = V/R = 20/30
s
= 2/3 A = 667 mA and (ii) Transient current i =−(V/R)e −t/λ .

Total current is i=I +i . Let us find the value of transient current after various time

The values of i and i at various times are tabulated below. Value of i = I + i

2.0 0.514 -344 323 4.5 0.223 –148 519
It is seen that whereas transient current decreases exponentially, total circuit current
increases exponentially as expected (Fig. 22.4).
Example 22.2. A circuit of resistance 10 Ω and inductance 0.1 H in series has a direct
voltage of 200 V suddenly applied to it. Find the voltage drop across the inductance at the instant
of switching on and at 0.01 second. Find also the flux-linkages at these instants.
(Basic Electricity, Bombay Univ.)
Solution. (i) Switching instant
At the instant of switching on, i = 0, so that iR = 0 hence all applied voltage must drop across
the inductance only. Therefore, voltage drop across inductance = 200 V.
Since at this instant i = 0, there are no flux-linkages of the coil.
(ii) When t = 0.01 second
As time passes, current grows so that the applied voltage is partly dropped across the
resistance and partly across the coil. Let us first find iR drop for which purpose, we need the value
of i at t = 0.01 second.
Now, time period of the circuit is λ = L/R = 0.1/10 = 0.01 second. Since the given time
happens to be equal to time constant,
∴ i = (200/10) × 0.632 = 12.64 A; iR = 152.64 × 10 = 126.4 V
Drop across inductance = 2002−126.42 = 155 V
Now, L = N Φ/i or NΦ=Li
∴ Flux-linkages Li = 0.1 × 12.64 = 1.264 Wb-turns.
Example 22.3. A coil of 10 H inductance and 5Ω resistance is connected in parallel with a
20 Ω resistor across a 100-V d.c. supply which is suddenly disconnected. Find
(a) the initial rate of change of current after switching.
(b) the voltage across the 20 Ω resistor initially and after 0.3 s.
(c) the voltage across the switch contacts at the instant of separation and
(d) the rate at which the coil is losing stored energy 0.3 second after switching.
Solution. (a) Since the steady-state current is zero, i=I e −t/λ
0
Now, when t = 0, current is = 100/5 = 20 A. It means the current flowing through the coil
immediately before opening the switch is 20 A.822 Electrical Technology
∴ I = 20 A
0
Hence, the above equation becomes i=20e −t/λ
Now λ=L/R=10/25=1/2.5 ∴ i=20e −2.5t
d
d

i
( 20 2.5e 2.5t)
t 0
– 50 A/s
t 0
The negative sign merely shows that the current is decreasing.
(b) After the supply has been disconnected, the current through the 20-Ω resistor is i since
it is in series with the coil.
Initial p.d. across the 20Ω resistor = (current at t = 0) × 20 = 20 × 20 = 400 V
Current through the resistor after 0.3 second = 20e −2.5×0.3 =9.45A
∴ Voltage across the resistor after 0.3 second
= (current at t = 0.3 second) × 20 = 9.45 × 20 = 189 V
(c) The e.m.f. induced in the coil at break tends to maintain the current through it in the
original direction. Hence, the direction of the current through 20 Ω resistor is upwards so that the
p.d. across the switch contacts will be the sum of supply voltage and the voltage across 20Ω
resistor.
∴ Initial voltage across switch contacts = 400 + 100 = 500 V
(d) The rate of loss of energy = power = induced e.m.f. in coil × current (after 0.3 s)

Now, after 0.3 second, i = 9.45 A
Value of di/dt after 0.3 second = – 20 × 2.5 × e–0.75 = – 23.6 A/second
∴ Rate of loss of energy = – 10 × 23.6 × 9.45 = – 2,230 joule/second
22.7. Transients in R-L Circuits (A.C.)
Let a voltage given by v = V sin (ωt+Ψ) be suddenly applied across an R-L circuit [Fig.
m
22.5 (a)] at a time when t = 0. It means that the voltage is applied when it is passing through the
value V sin Ψ. Since the contact may be closed at any point of the cycle, angle Ψ may have any
m
value lying between zero and 2π radians. The resultant current, as before, is given by
i = i + i
s t
Fig. 22.5Transients 823
The value of steady-state current is found by the normal circuit theory. The peak steady-state
current is given by
V V
I = m = m
m R2+X 2 Z
L
where R2+X 2 is the impedance of the circuit. This current lags behind the applied voltage by
L
an angle φ such that tan φ = X /R or φ = tan–1 (X /R)
L L
Hence, the equation for the instantaneous value of the steady-state current becomes
i =I sin(ωt+Ψ−φ)
s m
As before, the transient current is given by
i =I e −t/λ ∴i=I sin(ωt+Ψ−φ)+I e −t/λ ... (i)
t 0 m 0
Now, when t = 0, i = 0, hence putting these values in Eq. (i) above, we get
0=I sin(Ψ−φ)+I ∴I =−I sin(Ψ−φ)
m 0 0 m
Hence Eq. (i) can be written as
i=I sin(ωt+Ψ−φ)−I sin(Ψ−φ)e −t/λ ... (ii)
m m
From the above, it is seen that the value of I and hence the size of the transient current
0
depends on angle Ψ i.e. it depends on the instant in the cycle at which the circuit is closed. We
will consider the following three cases :
Case 1
When t = 0, let the voltage pass through its zero value and become positive i.e. let Ψ=0. In
that case, putting this value of Ψ in Eq. (ii), we get
i=I sin(ωt−φ)−I sin(−φ)e −t/λ =I [sin(ωt−φ)+sinφe −t/λ ]
m m m
This is shown in Fig. 22.5 (b). It is seen that maximum instantaneous peak current OB is
larger than the normal peak current OA.
Case 2
Let t = 0 when voltage is passing through its value V sin (φ) so that Ψ=φor Ψ−φ=0
m
In that, I = 0, there is no transient current at the time of switching on (i.e. i = 0 ). It
0 t
corresponds to the contacts closing at the instant when the steady state current itself is zero.
Case 3
When t = 0, let the voltage be passing through
V sin i.e. and /2
m 2 2
In this case, the transient [as found from Eq. (ii)] would be given by
i I sin .e t/ I e t/
t m 2 m
Under these conditions, the transient would have its maximum possible initial value.
Example 22.4. A 1.0 H choke has a resistance of 50 Ω. This choke is supplied with an a.c.
voltage given by e = 141 sin 314 t. Find the expression for the transient component of the current
flowing through the choke after the voltage is suddenly switched on.
(Principles of Elect. Engg-II, Jadavpur Univ.)
Solution. The equation of the transient component of the current is (Art. 22.7 Case 1)824 Electrical Technology
i =I sinφe −t/λ
t m
Here, λ= L/R = 1/50 = 0.02 second ; Z = 50 + j 314 = 318 ∠80.95º
I = V /Z = 141/318 = 0.443 A; sin 80.95º = 0.9875
m m
∴ i = 0.443 × 0.9875 e–t/0.02 = 0.4376e–t/0.02

Example 22.5. A 50-Hz sinusoidal voltage of maximum value of 400 V is applied to a series
circuit of resistance 10 Ω and inductance 0.1 H. Find tan expression for the value of the current at
any instant after the voltage is applied, assuming that voltage is zero at the instant of application.
Calculate its value 0.02 second after switching on (Electric Circuit, Punjab Univ. 1990)
Solution. In such cases, as seen from Art. 22.7 (Case 1), the current consists of a steady-state
component and a transient component. The equation of the resultant current is

Substituting t = 0.02 second, we get
i = 12.1 (sin (314 × 0.02 – 1.262) + 0.9527 e–2}
= 12.1 (sin 5.02 + 0.9527 e–2) = 12.1 (sin 288º + 0.9527 e–2)
= 12.1 (– sin 72º + 0.9527 × 0.1353) = 12.1 (– 0.9511 + 0.1289) = –9.95 A
Example 22.6. An alternating voltage v = 400 sin (314 t + Ψ) is suddenly applied across a
coil of resistance 0.2 Ω and inductance 6.36 mH. Determine the first peak value of the resultant
current when the transient current has maximum value.
Solution. Obviously, ω = 314 rad/s
X = ωL = 314 × 6.36 × 10–3 = 2 Ω
L
∠
Coil impedance Z = 0.2 + j2 ~ 2 84.3º
Max. value of steady-state current = 400/2 = 200 A
As seen from Art. 22.7, the maximum value of transient current will occur when
Ψ=φ±π/2 where φ = 84.3º i.e. the phase angle of the current w.r.t. voltage
∴ Ψ = 84.3º – 90º = – 5.7º
∴ resultant current, i = 400 sin (314 t – 90º) + I e–31.4t
0
Now, at t = 0, i = 0 ∴ 0 = 400 sin (– 90º) + I
0
∴ I = 400 A
0
Hence, the above equation becomes
i = 400 sin (ωt – 90º) + 400 e–31.4t
The procedure for determining an exact solution for the first peak of the resultant current is
first to differentiate the above expression, next to equate the result to zero and then to solve the
resulting expression graphically for t. However, sufficiently accurate result can be obtained by
determining the instant at which steady-state current reaches its first positive peak value and thenTransients 825
to add to it the value of the transient current at this instant. The first peak value of steady-state
current occurs when
(314 t – 90º) = π/2 rad ; i.e. when t = π/314 = 0.01 second
At this time, i = 400 e–0.314 = 292 A
t
∴ resultant current i at this time = 200 + 292 = 492 A
22.8. Transients in R-C Weeries Circuits (D.C.)

(ii) Discharge Current
When the capacitor has become fully charged
so that charging current has ceased, then the R-C
circuit is short-circuited by shifting the switch S
from position 1 to position 2 (Fig. 22.6). On doing
so, a transient discharge current will start flowing
immediately. If time is reckoned from the instant of
short-circuit, then when t = 0, i = I , hence from
t 0
Eq. (ii) above v = – I , R. Moreover, when t = 0, v

across the capacitor, from Eq. (i), we get v = v .

It is plotted in Fig. 22.8 (a). The negative sign

opposite to that in which the charging current flows. Fig. 22.8
That is why the curve has been drawn below the X-
axis. It may be noted that the only voltage in the circuit is v which equals −iR.

22.9. Transients in R-C Series Circuits (A.C.)
In this case, the resultant currents can be determined in the same way as for an R-L circuit
(Art. 22.7). It is given by
Fig. 22.11
i=i +i =I sin(ωt+ψ+φ)+I e −t/λ where I =V / R2+X 2
s t m 0 m m C
and v=V sin(ωt+ψ)

The value of I as found from initial known conditions (t = 0, i = 0) is given by I = –I sin (ψ+φ)
0 0 m
Hence, the resultant current becomes
i=I sin(ωt+ψ+φ)
m

As shown in Fig. 22.11, the resultant current at the moment of switch closing is OA and is
made up of steady-state current OC and transient current OB.
22.10. Double Energy Transients
In an R-L-C circuit, both electromagnetic and electrostatic energies are involved, hence any
sudden change in the conditions of the circuit involves the redistribution of these two forms of
energy. The transient currents produced due to this redistribution are known as double-energy
transients. The transient current produced may be unidirectional or a decaying oscillatory current.
In an R-L-C circuit, the transient voltages across the three circuit parameters are
i ,R,(Ldi /dt) and q /C. Hence, the equation of the transient voltage is

Depending on the value of λ and λ , four different conditions of the circuit are
1 2
distinguishable. We will now examine these four conditions in the case of an R-L-C circuit.
Case 1. Loss-free Circuit, R = 0 i.e. Undamped
1 1
In this case, λ = − = j−1 LC =−jωand λ =− − =−j−1 LC =−jω

Hence, Eq. (iii) given above becomes

Eq. (iv) can be still further simplified to
i =I sin(ωt+φ) ... (v)
t m
where I = A2+B2 and φ=tan −1(A/B)
m
As seen from Eq. (v), the transient current in this case is sinusoidal wave of constant peak
value and frequency f =1/2π LC as shown in Fig. 22.12 (a). The values of two constant terms
I and φ can be determined from any two known initial circuit conditions which are (i) the initial
m
current in the inductance and (ii) the initial voltage across the capacitor.

Case 2. Low-loss Circuit: < i.e. Under-damped

In this case, λ and λ would be conjugate complex numbers because the term under the
1 2
square root sign in each case would be negative.

Putting these values in equation (v), we get
i =ke(−a+jω)t +k e(−a−jω)t =e −at(kejωt +k e −jωt)
t 1 2 1 2
This equation can be reduced, as before, to the form

where I and φ are constants as before. Equation (vi) represents damped transient oscillatory

The exponential term e −at which accounts for the decay of oscillations, is called the decay
or damping factor or merely decrement. It makes each current peak a definite fraction less than
that preceding it. The logarithm to the Naperian base ‘e’ of the ratio of peaks one cycle apart in
time is a/ f =R/2fL and is referred to as logarithmic decrement. The frequency of damped
oscillations is given by

f = − and is called the natural frequency of the circuit

∴ i =e −at{(k +k )coshγt+(k −k )sinhγt}

In this case,

Hence, equation (iii) is reduced to

i t =(k 1 +k 2 t)e − 2L t or i t =(k 1 +k 2 t)e −at
It is a case of critical damping because current is reduced to almost zero in the shortest
possible time. The above equation has been plotted in Fig. 22.12 (d).
Hence, we can summarize as follows:
1. Transient current is an undamped sine wave if R = 0
2. Transient current is non-oscillatory if R<2 L/C
3. Transient current is non-oscillatory if R≥2 L/C
4. Critical damping occurs if R=2 L/C
Example 22.9. A 5-μF capacitor is discharged suddenly through a coil having an
inductance of 2H and a resistance of 200 Ω. The capacitor is initially charged to a voltage of
10 V. Find
(a) an expression for the current
(b) the additional resistance required to give critical damping.
Solution. Since there is no battery or generator in the circuit (Fig. 22.13), the steady-state
current must be zero. It means that resultant current is simply the transient current.
Fig. 22.13
Value of2 L/C =2 2/5×10 −6

Since R<2 L/C , the circuit is originally oscillatory.
(a) the expression for the transient current, therefore, is

Two initial conditions are known from which I and φ can be found (a) at t = 0; i = 0 and

(b) at t = 0; v = 10 V. Applying condition (a) to Eq. (i), we get
c
0=I sinφ, hence φ=0 ∴ i=I e −50tsin312.3t ... (ii)
m m
Now, at t = 0, the voltage across the inductance must be 10 V because the current in the
resistance is zero.
i.e. (Ldi/dt) = 10 V∴ (di/dt) =10/L = 5 A/s ... (iii)
t=0 t=0
Now, from equation (ii), we have
di =−50I e −50tsin312.3t+312.3I e −50t cos312.3t ... (iv)

Putting t = 0, it becomes (di/dt) =312.3I
t=0 m
From equation (iii), we have
312.3I =5 ∴I = 5/312.3 = 0.016 A
m m
Hence, the general expression for the current becomes
i = 0.016 e–50t sin 312.3t
It is roughly plotted (the first few cycles only) in Fig. 22.13 (b).
(b) Critical damping is achieved when R = 2 L/C
∴ R=2 2/5×10 −6 =1265Ω
∴ Additional resistance reqd. = 1265 – 200 = 1065 Ω
Example 22.10. A damped oscillation has the equation i=50e −10t sin 628t. Find the
number of oscillations which occurs before the amplitude of the oscillations decays to 1/10th of
its undamped value.
Solution. Undamped amplitude = 50 A
1/10th amplitude = (1/10) × 50 = 5A
Let the time required for this decay be t. Now, the decay of the peak of the oscillations is
given by the term 50e −10t
∴ 5=50e −10t ∴ e10t 1 = 10 or 10t =logh10 =2.3log10 =2.3
1 1 1 10
∴ t = 0.23 second

Frequency of oscillations = 628/2π = 100 Hz.
Hence, the number of oscillations which occur before the amplitude falls to 1/10th of its
undamped value is = 0.23 × 100 = 23
Example 22.11. If, in Fig. 22.14, a break occurs at a point marked X, what would be the
voltage across the break? It may be assumed that prior to the break, steady conditions existed in
the circuit.
Solution. Steady-state current through the inductance =

When the break occurs, the energy stored in the inductor is transferred to the capacitor. If loss
of energy during first transfer is neglected, then maximum energy stored in the capacitor is

∴ V = 2×24×10 −3×108 = 2,190 V

capacitor.

sequence Component of vectors (whether representing voltages
Voltage or currents) can be resolved into three
balanced systems of vectors which are
called its 'symmetrical components'836 Electrical Technology
23.1. Introduction
The method of symmetrical components was first proposed by C.L. Fortescue and has been
found very useful in solving unbalanced polyphase circuits, for analytical determination of the
Fig. 23.1 Fig. 23.2
performance of polyphase electrical machinery when operated from a system of unbalanced
voltages and for calculation of currents resulting from unbalanced faults. According to Fortescue’s
theorem, any unbalanced 3-phase system of vectors (whether representing voltages or currents) can
be resolved into three balanced systems of vectors which are called its ‘symmetrical components’.
In Fig. 23.1 (a) is shown a set of three unbalanced voltage vectors V , V and V having phase
A B C
sequence A→B→C. These can be regarded as made up of the following symmetrical
components :-
(i) A balanced system of 3-phase vectors V , V and V having the phase sequence
A1 B1 C1
A→B→C as the original set of three unbalanced vectors. These vectors constitute the positive-
sequence components [Fig. 23.1 (b)].
(ii) A balanced system of 3-phase vectors V , V and V
A2 B2 C2
having phase sequence A→C→B which is opposite to that of the
original unbalanced vectors. These vectors constitute the negative-
sequence components [Fig. 23.1 (c)].
(iii) A system of three vectors V , V and V which are equal
A0 B0 C0
in magnitude and are in phase with each other i.e. V = V = V .
A0 B0 C0
These three co-phasal vectors form a uniphase system and are known
as zero-sequence components [Fig. 23.1(d).]
Hence, it means that an unbalanced 3-phase system of voltages
or current can be regarded as due to the superposition of two
symmetrical 3-phase systems having opposite phase sequences and a
system of zero phase sequence i.e. ordinary single-phase current or
voltage system. In Fig. 23.2, each of the original vectors has been 3-phase monitor continuously

23.2. The Positive - sequence Components
As seen from above, the positive-sequence components have been designated as V , V and
A1 B1
V . The subscript 1 is meant to indicate that the vector belongs to the positive-sequence system.
C1
The letter refers to the original vector of which the positive-sequence vector is a component part.
These positive-sequence vectors are completely determined when the magnitude and phase of
any one of these is known. Usually, these vectors are related to each other with the help of the
operator a (for details, please refer to Art. 12.11). As seen from Fig. 23. 1 (b).
V = V ; V = a2V = V ∠–120°; V = aV ==V ∠120°
A1 A1 B1 A1 A1 C1 A1 A1
23.3. The Negative - sequence Components
This system has a phase sequence of A→C→B. Since this system is also balanced, it is
completely determined when the magnitude and phase of one of the vectors becomes known. The
suffix 2 indicates that the vector belongs to the negative-sequence system. Obviously, as seen from
Fig. From 23.1 (c).
V = V ; V = a V = V = ∠120°; V = a2V = V ∠−120°
A2 A2 B2 A2 A2 C2 A2 A2
23.4. The Zero - sequence Components
These three vectors are equal in magnitude and phase and hence form what is known as
uniphase system. They are designated as V , V and V . Since these are indentical in magnitude

∴ V = V = V

The procedure for evaluating V is as follows :

Multiplying (v) by a and (vi) by a2, we get
aV = a3V + a2V + aV ; a2V = a3V + a4V + a2V

Now a3 = 1and a4 = a, hence838 Electrical Technology
aV = V + a2V + aV ... (vii)
B 1 2 0
a2V = V + aV + a2V .... (viii)
C 1 2 0
Adding (iv), (vii) and (viii), we get
V + aV + a2V = 3V + V (1 + a + a2) + V (1 + a + a2) = 3V

Example 23.4. A 3-phase, 4-wire system supplies loads which are unequally distributed on

negative phase sequence current is 100 ∠60°. The total observed current flowing back to the
supply in the neutral conductor is 300 ∠300° A. Calculate the currents in phase and magnitude
in the three lines.
Assuming that the 3-phase supply voltages are symmetrical and that the power factor of the
load on the R-phase is 3/2 leading, determine the power factor of the loads on the two other
phases.

Since the power factor of the R-phase is 3/2 leading, the current I leads the voltage V

power factor of Y phase is also 3/2 leading. The power factor of B line is indeterminate because
the current in this line is zero.

23.9. Zero-Sequence Components of Current and Voltage
Any circuit which allows the flow of positive-sequence currents will also allow the flow of
negative-sequence currents because the two are similar. However, a fourth wire is necessary if
zero-sequence components are to flow in the lines of the 3-phase system. It follows that the line
currents of 3-phase 3-wire system can contain no zero sequence components whether it is delta -
or star-connected. The zero sequence components of line-to-line voltages are non-existent
regardless of the degree of imbalance in these voltages. It means that a set of unbalanced 3-phase,
line-to-line voltages may be represented by a positive system and a negative system of balanced
voltages. This fact is of considerable importance in the analysis of 3-phase rotating machinery. For
example, the operation of an induction motor when supplied from an unbalanced system of 3-phase
voltages, may be analysed on the basis of two balanced systems of voltages of opposite phase
sequence.
Let us consider some typical 3-phase connections with reference to zero-sequence
components of current and voltage.
(a) Four-wire Star Connection. Due to the presence of the fourth wire, the zero sequence
currents may flow. The neutral wire carries only the zero-sequence current which is the sum of the
zero-sequence currents in the three lines. Since the sum of line voltages is zero, there can be no
zero sequence component of line voltages.
(b) Three-wire Star Connection. Since there is no fourth or return wire, zero-sequence
components of current cannot flow. The absence of zero-sequence currents may be explained by
considering that the impedance offered to these currents is infinite and that this impedance is
situated between the star points of the generator and the load. If the two star points were joined by
a neutral, only zero-sequence currents will flow through it so that only zero-sequence voltage can
exist between the load and generator star points. Obviously, no zero-sequence component of
voltage appears across the phase load.
(c) Three-wire Delta Connection. Due to the absence of fourth wire, zero-sequence
components of currents cannot be fed into the delta-connected load. However, though line currents844 Electrical Technology
have to sum up to zero (whereas phase currents need not do so) it is possible to have a zero-
sequence current circulating in the delta-connected load.
Similarly, individual phase voltages will generally possess zero-sequence components though
components are absent in the line-to line voltage.*
23.10. Unbalanced Star Load Supplied from Unbalanced Three-phase Three-
wire System
In this case, line voltages and load currents will consist of only positive and negative-
sequence components (but no zero-sequence component). But load voltages will consist of
positive, negative and zero-sequence components.
Let the line voltages be denoted by V , V and V , line (and load) currents by I , I and

Example 23.8. Explain the terms: positive-, negative- and zero-sequence components of a
3-phase voltage system. A star-connected load consists of three equal resistors, each of 1 Ω
resistance. When the load is connected to an unsymmetrical 3-phase supply, the line voltages are
200 V, 346 V and 400 V.
Find the magnitude of the current in any one phase by the method of symmetrical
components. (Power Systems-II, A.M.I.E.)
Solution. This question could be solved by using the following two methods:
(a) As shown in Fig. 23.6(a), the line voltages form a closed right-angled triangle with an
angle = tan −1(346/200)=tan −1(1.732)=60°
Hence, if V = 200 ∠0°, then V = 346 ∠– 90° = – j346 and V = 400 ∠120°.

Example 23.10. Two equal impedance arms AB and BC are connected to the terminalsA,B,

23.12. Measurement of Symmetrical Components of Circuits
The apparatus consists of two identical current transformers, two impedances of the same
ohmic value, one being more inductive than the other to the extent that its phase angle is 60°
greater and two identical ammeters A greater and two identical ammeters A and A as shown in
1 1 2
Fig. 23.8 (a). It can be shown that A reads positive-sequence current only while A reads negative-

zero-sequence component is zero, we have

Hence, the voltmeter connected between points D and E measures 3 times the positive
sequence component of the phase voltage. So do the other two voltmeters.
In Fig. 23.9 (b), the elements have been reversed. It can be shown that provided the same
relation is maintained between the elements, the high impedance voltmeter measures 3 times the
negative-sequence component of phase voltage.

24.1. Preference for Electricity
Energy is vital for all living-beings on earth. Modern life-style has further increased its
importance, since a faster life means faster transport, faster communication, and faster manufacturing
processes. All these lead to an increase in energy required for all those modern systems.
Arising out of comparison of status of nations, the progress is related in terms of per capita
consumption of electrical energy (i.e. kWH consumed per person per year). At present, this parameter
for India is about 300, for UK it is 12 to 15 times more, and for USA, it is about 30 times more.
It simply means that Electrical energy is the most popular form of energy, whether we require
it in the usable thermal form (= heating applications), in mechanical form (= electrical motor-
applications in Industries), for lighting purposes (= illumination systems), or for transportation systems.
Following are the main reasons for its popularity.
1. Cleaner environments for user
2. Higher efficiency
3. Better controllability
4. Easier bulk-power, long-distance transportation of power using overhead transmission or
underground cables
5. Most versatile devices of energy conversions from Electrical to other forms are available for
different purposes, such as thermal, illumination, mechanical, sound, chemical, etc.
24.2. Comparison of Sources of Power
While selecting a method of generating electricity, following factors are taken into account for
purposes of comparison:
(a) Initial cost: For a given rating of a unit (in the minds of planners), investment must be
known. Naturally, lower the initial cost, better it is.
(b) Running Cost:- To produce a given amount of electrical energy, the cost of conversion
process (including proportional cost of maintenance/repairs of the system) has to be known.
(c) Limitations:- Whether a particular resource is available, whether a unit size of required
rating is available from a single unit or from an array of large number of units, and whether
a particular method of generation is techno-economically viable and is time-proven, are
typical queries related to the limitations of the concerned method.
(d) (1) perpetuity, (2) efficiency, (3) reliability, (4) cleanliness and (5) simplicity.
It is naturally desirable that the source must have perpetuity (= be of endless duration),
high conversion efficiency, and reliability (in terms of availability in appropriate quantity).
The energy conversion must be through a cleaner process (specially from the view- points
of toxicity, pollution or any other hazardous side effects). Further, a simpler overall system
is always preferred with regards to maintenance/repairs problems and is supposed to be
more reliable.
24.3. Sources for Generation of Electricity
Following types of resources are available for generating electrical energy (No doubt, this
list can be extended to include some more up-coming resources. The following list, however, gives
the popular and potential resources).
(a) Conventional methods
(a) Thermal: Thermal energy (from fossil fuels) or Nuclear Energy used for producing steam
for turbines which drive the alternators (= rotating a.c. generators).
(b) Hydro-electric: Potential of water stored at higher altitudes is utilized as it is passed through
water-turbines which drive the alternators.
(b) Non-conventional methods
(c) Wind power: High velocities of wind (in some areas) are utilized in driving wind turbines
coupled to alternators. Wind power has a main advantage of having zero production cost.
The cost of the equipment and the limit of generating-unit-rating is suitable for a particularIntroduction to Electrical Energy Generation 857
location (= geographically) are the important
constraints. This method has exclusive advantages
of being pollution free and renewable. It is
available in plentiful quantity, at certain places. It
suffers from the disadvantages of its availability
being uncertain (since dependent on nature) and
the control being complex (since wind-velocity has
wide range of variation, as an input, and the output
required is at constant voltage and constant
frequency). Single large-power units cannot be
planned due to techno-economic considerations.
(d) Fuel cells: These are devices which enable direct
Use of Wind Powder
conversion of energy, chemically, into electrical
form. This is an up-coming technology and has a special merit of being pollution-free and
noise-free. It is yet to become popular for bulk-power generation.
(e) Photo voltaic cells: These directly convert solar energy into electrical energy through a
chemical action taking place in solar cells. These operate based on the photo-voltaic effect,
which develops an emf on absorption of ionizing radiation from Sun.
Power Scenario In India:-
Following approximate statistical data give an idea about some aspects in this regard.
Total installed capacity : 150,000 MW
Hydropower : 50,000 MW
Nuclear : 10,000 MW
Thermal (fossil fuels) : 80,000 MW
Other methods : 10,000 MW
Other methods include partly exploited Potential such as Wind, Solar, Co-generation, Methods
using Bio-fuels, etc.
24.4. Brief Aspects of Electrical Energy Systems
24.4.1. Utility and Consumers
At generating stations, power is generated at the best locations. Load-centres are generally
away from these. Generation-units and Loads are connected by transmission systems. Thus, the energy
system is divided into two main parts.
(a) Utility (including sources and transmission network) and,
(b) Consumers (who utilize the electrical energy)
24.4.2. Why is the three- phase a. c. system most popular?
(a) It is well known that a.c. generation is simpler (than d.c. generation through electrical machines
because of absence of commutators in a.c. machines). Further, mechanical commutation
system in d.c. machines sets an upper limit of their size, while the rating of the individual
generators in modern power stations is too large, say about 1500 times the rating of a single
largest feasible d.c. machine. A.C. further facilitates in stepping down or stepping-up of a
voltage to suit a particular requirement, with the help of a simple device, the well-known
transformer.
(b) Changing over from a.c. to d.c. is very easy these days due to the rectifiers of sufficiently
high power ratings, so that a wide range of d.c. – applications can now be catered to.
(c) As the number of phases goes on increasing the power-output (from a device using a given
quantity of active material, namely, that used for core and for winding) increases, but the
number of circuits (i.e. connecting lines/ wires, switches, etc) also increases.
These two points are contradictory. A choice will be in favour of such a number (of phases)
which will be high enough from power-output point of view but low enough from viewpoints858 Electrical Technology
of complexity of connecting/controlling large number of phases. There is a Golden
compromise. It has resulted into popularity of the three-phase a. c. systems over the entire
time period. Now it has almost become a standard practice for all purposes.
24.4.3. Cost of Generation
Cost of generation for one unit of electrical energy depends on the method of generation,
formulae worked to assess its running cost under the specified conditions, and the cost of transmission
line loss to transport power upto the load. These days, a modern utility (= electricity board) has a
large number of generators sharing the responsibility of supplying power to all the customers connected
to the Grid (= common supply-network). Then, for an increase in load-demand, at a known location,
the most economical generating unit is to be identified and that unit should be monitored to meet the
increased demand.
24.4.4. Staggering of Loads during Peak-demand Hours
Incentives to consumers (by way of supplying at reduced rates during light load hours e.g.
Late night ‘hours, after noon hours) help in even demand throughout the day.
24.4.5. Classifications of Power Transmission
(a) Using underground cables or using overhead transmission lines.
(b) Extra High Voltage A.C.-versus-Extra High Voltage D.C. transmission systems.
24.4.6. Selecting A.C. Transmission Voltage for a Particular Case
In general, for transporting a given power of V I watts, either V can be high or V can be low.
Accordingly, the current can be either low or high respectively. Higher voltage means higher cost of
insulation, and larger clearances. Higher current means larger cross section of conductors. Considering
these together, the most economical voltage has to be found out for a particular requirement.
Kelvin’s Laws give a guideline for this. (These are discussed in Art. 47.21 in Vol. III, of this book).
24.5. Conventional Sources of Electrical Energy
Thermal (coal, gas, nuclear) and hydro-generations are the main conventional methods of
generation of Electrical Energy. These enjoy the advantages of reaching perfections in technologies
for these processes. Further, single units rated at large power-outputs can be manufactured along with
main components, auxiliaries and switch- gear due to vast experiences during the past century. These
are efficient and economical.
These suffer from the disadvantages listed below:
1. The fuels are likely to be depleted in near future, forcing us to conserve them and find
alternative resources.
2. Toxic, hazardous fumes and residues pollute the environment.
3. Overall conversion efficiency is poor.
4. Generally, these are located at remote places with respect to main load centres, increasing the
transmission costs and reducing the system efficiency.
5. Maintenance costs are high.
Out of these, only two such types will be dealt here, which have a steam turbine working as the
prime mover. While remaining two use Internal Combustion Engines (I.C. engines) or Gas
turbine as the prime mover, and these will not be dealt with, in this Introductory treatment.
The steam-turbine driven systems are briefly discussed below.
24.5.1. Steam Power Stations (Coal-fired)
India has rich stocks of coal as a natural resource. Chemical energy stored within the coal is
finally transformed into Electrical energy through the process of these stations. Heat released by the
combustion of coal produces steam in a boiler at elevated temperatures and pressures. It is then
passed through steam turbines, which drive the alternator, the output of which is the electrical energy.Introduction to Electrical Energy Generation 859
Figure 24.1 shows a simple schematic diagram of a modern coal-fired thermal station.
In India, coal is generally of low grade containing ash upto 40 %. It poses two problems.
(i) Calorific value is low and hence system efficiency can be increased only by additional processes
like pulverizing the coal and using oil firing to start with, (ii) large volumes of ash have to be handled
after ensuring that ash is extracted to the maximum possible extent (upto 99 %) by using electrostatic
precipitators, before flue gases from boiler are finally passed on to the atmosphere.
Coal is burnt in the boiler. This heat converts water into steam when passed through the boiler
tubes. Modern plants have super heaters to raise the temperature and pressure of steam so that plant
efficiency is increased. Condenser and cooling tower deal with steam coming out of turbine. Here,
maximum heat is extracted from steam (which then takes the form of water) to pre-heat the incoming
water and also to recycle the water for its best utilization.
Steam-turbine receives controlled steam from boiler and converts its energy into mechanical
energy which drives the 3-ph a. c. generator (=alternator). The alternator delivers electrical energy, at
its rated voltage (which may be between 11 to 30 kV). Through a circuit breaker, the step up transformer
is supplied. Considering the bulk-power to be transmitted over long distances, the secondary rating

of this transformer may be 220 or 400 kV (as per figures for India). Through Extra-High Voltage
Switch gear, the Bus is energized and the EHV primary transmission line can transport power to the
Load centres connected to it.
A modern coal-fired thermal power station consumes about 10 % of its power for supplying to
the Auxiliaries. These are mainly as follows.
(a) Main-exciter for alternator. (b) Water pumps.
(c) Fans: Forced draught and Induced draught fans for Pre-heaters and Chimney.
(d) Coal handling plant including pulverising mill.
(e) Ash handling plant including Electrolytic Precipitator.
Naturally, whenever such a station is to be brought into operation (either at commissioning or
after repairs/maintenance schedule) the power required for the auxiliaries has to be supplied by the
grid. Once the system is energized fully, it will look after supplying power to its own auxiliaries.
Merits of Coal-fired thermal stations
1. Fuel (=coal) is cheap. 2. Less initial cost is required. 3. It requires less space.
4. As a combination of all above points, the cost of generating unit of electrical energy is less.860 Electrical Technology
Demerits
1. Atmospheric pollution is considerable.
2. Coal may have to be transported over long distances, in some cases, after some years, and then
the energy cost may be quite high.
24.5.2. Nuclear Power Stations
Nuclear energy is available as a result of fission reaction. In a typical system, Uranium 235 is
bombarded with neutrons and Heat energy is released. In chain-reaction, these release more neutrons,
since more Uranium 235 atoms are fissioned. Speeds of Neutrons must be reduced to critical speeds
for the chain reaction to take place. Moderators (= speed-reducing agents like graphite, heavy water,
etc). are used for this purpose. Nuclear fuel rods (of Uranium 235) must be embedded in speed-
reducing agents. Further, control rods (made of cadmium) are required since they are strong neutron-
absorbers and help in finely regulating this reaction so that power control of the generator is precisely
obtainable. When control rods are pulled out and are away from fuel rods, intensity of chain reaction
increases, which increases the power output of the system. While if they are pushed in and closer to
the fuel rods, the power-output decreases. Thus, the electrical load demand on the generator decides
(automatically) the control-rod positions through a very sophisticated control system.
Fig. 24.2 shows a basic scheme of such a Nuclear power-station.
Advantages of Nuclear Generation
1. Quantity of fuel required is small for generating a given amount of electrical energy, compared
to that with other fuels.
2. It is more reliable, cheaper for running cost, and is efficient when operated at rated capacity.
Disadvantages
1. Fuel is expensive and not abundantly available everywhere. 2. It has high capital cost.
3. Maintenance charges are high. 4. Nuclear waste disposal is a problem.

24.5.3. Hydroelectric Generation
Water-reservoir at higher altitudes is a pre-requisite for this purpose. Power-house is located
at a lower level. The difference in these two levels is known as “Head.”
Based on the “Heads”, the Hydroelectric stations are categorized below:
1. Low head up to 60 metres. 2. Medium head between 60 and 300 metres.
3. High heads above 300 metres.Introduction to Electrical Energy Generation 861
In this method of generation, water from higher height is passed through penstock as controlled
in the valve-house, into the water turbine. Thus, potential energy of water stored at higher altitudes is
first converted into Kinetic energy. As the water reaches the turbine, it gains speed after losing the
Potential energy. Kinetic energy of this speedy water drives the water turbine, which converts this
into mechanical output. It drives the coupled generator, which gives Electrical energy output.
A schematic diagram of such a system is shown in fig.
The valve house has a controlling valve (=main sluice valve) and a protecting valve (= an
automatic, isolating, “butterfly” type valve). As is obvious, power control is done by the main sluice
valve, while “butterfly” valve comes into action if water flows in opposite direction as a result of a
sudden drop in load on the generator. Otherwise, the penstock is subjected to extreme strains and it
has a tendency to burst due to pressure of water as a result of sudden load reduction.

After doing the work (of imparting its energy to the water turbine), the water is allowed to pass
into the tail-race reservoir.
The water turbines are essentially low-speed prime movers. In that, the best operating speed is
dependent on the head. Alternators coupled to water turbines thus have large number of poles (since
P= 120 f/N). Such alternators have the Salient-Pole type rotor.
There are different types of water turbines suitable for different cases (i.e. Heads, Power
rating, Load-variation curve, etc). Since, this is only an elementary treatment, these aspects will not
be discussed here.
24.6. Non-Conventional Energy Sources
Considering the previously discussed thermal methods of conventional energy-generations, it is
necessary to understand the non-conventional energy sources, since they have two points in their
favour.
(a) Non-polluting processes are used.
(b) Perpetuity and renewability of the main source (which is a natural atmospheric resource)
generally exists.
The non-conventional energy sources are further advantageous due to virtually zero running
cost, since wind energy or solar energy is the input-source of power.
However, they are disadvantageous due to high initial cost (per MW of installed capacity) and
due to uncertainty resulting out of weather changes. For example, dense clouds (or night hours) lead
to non-availability of solar energy. Similarly, “still-air” condition means no possibility of wind power
generation, and during stormy weathers, wind turbines cannot be kept in operation (due to dangerously
high speeds they would attain if kept in operation).
24.6.1. Photo Voltaic Cells (P.V. Cells or SOLAR Cells)
When ionized solar radiation is incident on a semi-conductor diode, energy conversion can take
place with a voltage of 0.5 to 1 volt (d.c.) and a current density of 20-40 mA/cm2, depending on the862 Electrical Technology
materials used and the conditions of
Sunlight. Area of these solar cells decides

number of such diodes (i.e. Solar cells)
results into higher d.c. output voltage.
Since, the final form of electrical
energy required is generally an alternating

vertical stacks, so that land area required

is not too vast. Electrically, they are
connected in series and in parallel
combinations of cells so that rated voltage and current are realized.
Just to understand the principle of operation of solar cells, let a semi-conductor diode receive
ionized radiation from Sun, as in fig. 24.4.
Typical materials used for these cells are: material doped with boron, cadmium sulphide, gallium-
arsenide, etc. Their choice is mainly decided by conversion efficiency. Best material may lead to the
efficiency being typically 15%. Since solar energy is available free of cost, this low-efficiency does
not matter.
This method suffers from the disadvantages of having high initial cost and uncertainty (since
dependent on weather conditions) including non operative night periods. Main advantages are: (i) no
running cost (however, replacements of components may be a botheration), (ii) no pollution,
(iii) location can be near the load (hence transportation of power is not required over long distances).
(iv) since natural source is involved, it is perpetual.
Individual stations using solar cells are in operation with ratings of the order of 250-1000 kW.
With manufacturing costs of semi-conductor devices going down and with the advent of better and
better quality of cells which will be available in future, this method of generation has bright prospects.
24.6.2. Fuel Cells
24.6.2.1. Principle of Operation
In Fuel cells, negative porous electrode is fed by hydrogen and the positive porous electrode is
fed by oxygen. Both the electrodes are immersed in an electrolyte. The porous electrodes are made of
such a conducting material that both the fuel (oxygen and hydrogen) and the electrolyte can pass
through them. Such a material for electrodes is nickel. The electrolyte is a solution of sulphuric acid
or potassium hydroxide. The electrodes have a catalyst (= platinum or sintered nickel) which break
the fuel compound into more reactive atoms.
24.6.2.2. Chemical Process (with Acidic Electrolyte)
At Negative Electrode : 2H —→ 4H+ + 4e
2
These hydrogen ions enter the solution (=electrolyte) leaving behind electrons which pass
through external circuit to the positive electrode.
At Positive Electrode: O + 4H+ + 4 → 2HO
2 2
Thus, the combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen results into water at the positive electrode.
Water is the waste-product of the cell, which is harmless. The process is, thus, pollution free. There is
no source of energy required, since the process is basically “chemical” in nature.Introduction to Electrical Energy Generation 863

24.6.2.4. Array for Large outputs
A fuel cell has a d. c. output voltage typically of 1.23 volts at normal atmospheric pressure and
temperature. Raising pressure and temperature increases this voltage. To realize large output parameters
(= voltage, current, and hence power), an array of a large number of fuel cells (connected in series as
well as in parallel) is made. Voltage levels of 100 to 1000 V and power levels in kilowatts can be
realized.
24.6.2.5. High Lights
1. Pollution-free, noiseless.
2. No outside source of energy is required.
3. Efficient.
4. No restriction on location
(a) High initial cost. (b) Working life is short.
Note: Solar energy can also be used for generating electrical energy through an intermediate stage of
producing steam, which is used later for driving an alternator. However, this method is not discussed here.
24.6.3. Wind Power
24.6.3.1. Background
Wind power has been in use for serving the mankind, since centuries through what has been
popularly known as “Wind-mills.” There is no “electrical” stage of energy in old-styled uses where
wind-velocity is directly used for performing the jobs such as wheat-grinding, pumping water for
irrigation, sailing vessels, etc. It enjoys the advantages of being plentiful, inexhaustible, renewable
and non-polluting, over and above being cheap for running costs. It suffers from disadvantages of
being unreliable, and being economically un-viable for large power generation. In India, a large
number of such units with small and medium power ratings (up to 100 kW) are already in operation
mainly in coastal or hilly areas. With the modern system, it is now preferred to have suitable power-
control circuits on the output side of wind-generators so that these can pump energy into low voltage
lines of the grid over a wide range of variation of wind speeds.
24.6.3.2. Basic Scheme
A large variety of wind-turbines naturally exist arising out of large variation in wind-pattern864 Electrical Technology

designs. Since the aim here is
to understand the basic
system, only one type of
system is presented here.

with vertical axis of generator.
The speed of wind varies, as Fig. 24.7
such turbine speed also varies so that output frequency and voltage of three-phase alternator vary
over a wide range. Further, its waveform is also a distorted one. To increase its utility, it is necessary
to modulate (through proper power-control) to derive line-frequency constant voltage output and
hook-up to local grid for pumping the available wind-energy into it. This is schematically represented
in fig 24.7.
24.6.3.3. Indian Scenario
Wind farms have been located where a large number of wind generators of ratings of few
hundred kilowatts are in operation. For every unit, there is a safe wind - speed zone. If the wind-speed
is below this, there is no appreciable power output, hence, it is better that the system is not brought
into operation. If the wind speeds are too high, it is mechanically unsafe and hence it is not to be
operated, even if the energy available is higher. This is decided by automated system. Such forms are
located in coastal regions and in hilly areas. Because of the metering of energy received
by the local grid, the investor can get a good return through payment from the grid-authorities. Hence,
this has become a medium-level and attractive industrial investment.
